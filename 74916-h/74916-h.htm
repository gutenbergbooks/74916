<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The study of popular weather prognostics has been considered of such interest that
much attention has been given this subject by European meteorologists. It is proposed
to make the collection as complete as possible, and, with this in view, it is
requested that all popular weather sayings not found in this collection may be communicated
to the Chief Signal Officer of the Army. It is proper to add that the
weather forecasts of this office are not based upon the proverbs here given, but wholly
upon observations and generalizations accepted by meteorologists.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>: I have the honor to submit the following report of the “Popular
weather proverbs, prognostics, &#38;c.,” in use in the United States:</p>

<p class='c010'>The circular recently issued by you calling upon all observers, both
regular and voluntary, and the general public to coöperate with the Signal
Service in the collection of this information was widely distributed,
and the replies received contain special prognostics in use in each section
of this country. Many of these sayings express, in a crude form,
the meteorological conditions likely to follow, and have resulted, from
the close observation on the part of those whose interests compelled
them to be on the alert, in the study of all signs which might enable
them to determine approaching weather changes.</p>

<p class='c010'>The increase of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere is indicated by its
effect upon animal and vegetable organization. Animals are observed
to become restless before rain, and many prognostics are based upon
the action of birds, beasts, fish, reptiles, and insects. Plants and trees
also indicate change in the hygrometric condition of the surrounding
atmosphere by the expansion and contraction of their leaves or flowers.
The increase of aqueous vapor is indicated by the expansion or contraction
of various substances, such as wood, whalebone, cat-gut, sponge,
and hair, which, when colder than the air, condenses the moisture upon
them, and this being absorbed increases the temperature, thus causing
expansion or contraction. This action of heat and vapor upon these
various substances has been utilized by meteorologists in the construction
of hygrometers, and a number of the prognostics herewith express
the effect of moisture on the articles named.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have indicated only a limited number of those prognostics which depend
upon the quantity of vapor in the atmosphere with a view of illustrating
that a portion of these popular weather sayings are based upon
true meteorological conditions, and a thorough knowledge of this class
of prognostics may prove of service to the observer when instruments
are not at hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Those popular sayings referring to years, months, weeks, &#38;c., are not
considered of any real value in determining the weather forecasts for
the periods named. They are given that general attention may be directed
to this class of weather forecasts. The ablest meteorologists of
to-day, aided by the most perfect meteorological instruments and the
results of years of accurate instrumental observations, are still unable
to give reliable forecasts of the weather for a longer period than two or
three days, and frequently not longer than twenty-four hours. It is
possible that a more accurate observation of the condition of plants or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the condition and action of animals might lead to some valuable suggestion
in this important field of investigation. At least we may be permitted
to invite a wider field of observation in this branch of the science
so long as those most learned in meteorology are unable to inform the
agriculturist whether the approaching season will be wet or dry, warm
or cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have included in this report the interesting paper on Popular
Weather Prognostics by the Hon. Ralph Abercromby, F. M. S., and
William Marriott, F. M. S., which was read before the Meteorological
Society of London December 20, 1882. This paper is of special value
when considered in connection with the popular weather sayings given
in this report, as the relation existing between many of these prognostics
and the attending meteorological conditions as determined from instrumental
observations is clearly shown.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under head of General Prognostics will be found a paper of special
interest by Mr. Cushing, giving weather prognostics in use among the
Zuñi Indians of New Mexico.</p>

<p class='c010'>Part 2 contains the local indications of weather changes as determined
by Signal Service observers at several stations of the Signal Service.
Also table showing the wet and dry winds of each district for each month
of the year, with a district map showing the geographical boundaries of
the districts used in the preparation of weather indications of the Signal
Service.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>POPULAR WEATHER PROGNOSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c012'>By the Hon. <span class='sc'>Ralph Abercromby</span>, F. M. S., and <span class='sc'>William Marriott</span>, F. M. S., reprinted
from the “Quarterly Journal of the Meteorological Society,”  published in
London.</p>

<p class='c010'>The attempt to foretell the weather is not of recent date; the ancients
carefully studied the sky and clouds, and endeavored to predict the
kind of weather that was likely to ensue; and a number of the popular
prognostics of the weather of his time are recorded by Aristotle in his
work <em>on meteors</em>. In later times our forefathers studied the weather,
and as they had no instruments to guide them they observed natural
objects and noticed the appearances of the sky and clouds, and also
the movements of animals, birds, plants, &#38;c. Shepherds and sailors
especially being exposed to all kinds of weather, would naturally be on
the lookout for any signs of a coming change, and after a time would
begin to associate certain appearances with certain kinds of weather.
A good deal of weather wisdom of the above character has been thrown
into proverbs, trite sayings, and popular verse; and we propose in the
present paper to examine and explain some of these by the aid of the
most recent discoveries of meteorological science. A great advance
has been made in meteorology during the last twenty years, owing to
the introduction of daily synoptic charts of the distribution of atmospheric
pressure, temperature, wind, rain, &#38;c. From these it is evident
that there is a distinct relation existing between the distribution
of pressure and the direction and force of the wind, and the temperature
and weather generally. A glance at a number of the charts shows
that there is nearly always present either an area of low pressure, called
a cyclone, usually having an approximately circular form, and, as a rule,
moving in an easterly or northeasterly direction; or an area of high pressure,
called an anticyclone, also nearly circular in form, but almost stationary
in position. The wind in all cases also blows in a direction nearly
parallel with the isobars, having the region of lowest pressure on the
left hand. This has given rise to the simple law propounded by Dr.
Buy’s Ballot, for the northern hemisphere, viz: “Stand with your back
to the wind, and the barometer will be lower on your left hand than on
your right.” In cyclones the wind circulates in the opposite way to
which the hands of a watch move, but exhibits usually a little in-draught;
while in anticyclones the wind circulates in the same way as the hands
of a watch, but exhibits usually a little outward motion. The intensity
of the wind in all cases depends upon the closeness of the isobars; for
the closer the isobars the greater is the difference in pressure in a given
distance, and consequently the stronger the wind. Nearly all of our
weather is of the cyclonic or anticyclonic type, and is entirely dependent
upon the form and distribution of the isobars. It is, therefore, by the
aid of isobaric charts that we shall attempt to explain popular prognostics,
and to associate them with certain kinds of weather. The
method of research actually adopted has been for many years past to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>take notes of any good observation of any prognostic and put them in
a portfolio, with the nearest synoptic chart available, or preferably with
the nearest, both before and after. When a sufficient number had been
collected they were analyzed, and the remarkable result has been arrived
at that the greater number of prognostics are simply descriptive
of the weather and appearance of the sky, in the different portions of
the various shapes of isobars seen on synoptic charts, and that they
indicate foul or fair weather just as they precede the shifting areas of
rain or blue sky which are mapped out by the isobaric lines. These
charts not only show the success of the prognostics, but also explain
wherein they sometimes fail, by tracing the changes of each particular
condition of the weather. Hitherto the only prognostics which have
been accounted for have been those due to excessive damp, but by
means of isobaric charts many others can be readily explained. It
must not be supposed that the modern methods diminish the value of
prognostics, for even in forecasting weather from synoptic charts they
are of great value, and are always exceedingly useful to solitary observers
who have only a single barometer to depend upon besides these
prognostics, as, for instance, on board ship.</p>

<p class='c010'>We hope that the present paper will create an interest on the part of
many in this subject, and show that it is within their power to assist in
advancing the science of meteorology, so that it may not remain any
longer in the unsatisfactory state set forth in the following old Bedfordshire
lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Well, Duncombe, how will be the weather?”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Sir, it looks cloudy altogether,</div>
      <div class='line'>And coming across our Houghton Green,</div>
      <div class='line'>I stopped and talked with old Frank Beane.</div>
      <div class='line'>While we stood there, sir, old Jan Swain</div>
      <div class='line'>Went by and said he knowed ’twould rain;</div>
      <div class='line'>The next that came was Master Hunt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he declared he knew it wouldn’t.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then I met with Farmer Blow,</div>
      <div class='line'>He plainly said he didn’t know,</div>
      <div class='line'>So, sir, when doctors disagree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who’s to decide it, you or me?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>CYCLONE PROGNOSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>We shall first take a typical well formed cyclone. In the accompanying
diagram (Fig. 1) the broad features of the relation of cloud and
rain to a cyclone centre are shown, the full line indicating the path of
the depression, and the dotted line at right angles to it is the trough or
locus of the lowest reading of the barometer.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
<img src='images/i_011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 1.—Weather in a Cyclone, November 14, 1875.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the extreme front of the depression there is a blue sky, then, as
the barometer begins to fall, and sometimes even before that takes place,
a bank of cirro-stratus, preceded by a halo-bearing sky, makes its appearance,
which gradually becomes lower and denser, and forms an
overcast, dirty sky. In the whole front of the depression the temperature
rises, and the atmosphere feels muggy and close. In the right-hand
front the clouds assume the cumulo-stratus type, with driving rain
later on. In the left-hand front the air is cooler, but still oppressive,
with an easterly wind and overcast sky, succeeded by drizzling rain or
ill-defined showers. When the trough of the depression has passed the
barometer begins to rise, the wind changes and becomes squally, with
showers of rain; the air grows cooler, and the clouds break and ultimately
clear away.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, with regard to the prognostics with reference to Fig. 2, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the characteristic weather in the different portions of a depression are
given in a diagrammatic form, it will be seen that the first indication
of a coming change is the appearance of a halo round the sun or moon
in the cirro-stratus clouds. Hence,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When round the moon there is a brugh,</div>
      <div class='line'>The weather will be cold and rough.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The moon with a circle brings water in her beak.</p>

<p class='c016'>Halos predict a storm (rain and wind or snow and wind) at no great distance, and
the open side of the halo tells the quarter from which it may be expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mock suns predict a more or less certain change of weather.</p>

<img src='images/i_012.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 2.—Cyclone Prognostics.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>With regard to the open side of the halo indicating the quarter from
which the storm may be expected, it does not appear that this can be
much used as a prognostic. It, however, most probably originated in
the fact that halos are often seen in the southwest or west, when the
sun or moon is rather low, the lower portion of the halo being cut off
by clouds banking up in that direction, and that our storms generally
come from those quarters. As a specimen of the value of prognostics
we give some details of halos. When rain does not fall within thirty-six
hours, any subsequent rain probably belongs to a new depression.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the six years ending June, 1882, one hundred and fifty-five
solar halos and sixty-one lunar halos were observed in the neighborhood
of London, and they occurred with the following winds:</p>

<p class='c010'>From the same excessive damp the following may be explained:</p>

<p class='c021'>When the walls are more than usually damp rain is expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>Doors and windows are hard to shut in damp weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sailor notes the tightening of the cordage on his ship as a sign of coming rain.</p>

<p class='c017'>Also, owing to excessive moisture, clouds appear soft and lowering,
and reflect the glare of iron-works and the lights of large towns:</p>

<p class='c021'>The glare of the distant Ayrshire iron-works being seen at night from Cumbræ or

<p class='c016'>In Kinkardine of Monteith (Perthshire) and in all that district the reflections from

<p class='c017'>Also:</p>

<p class='c021'>When the flames of candles flare and snap or burn with an unsteady or dim light,
rain, and frequently wind also, are found to follow.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>This is especially applicable to oil-lamps or tallow candles.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the depression approaches and the atmosphere becomes gloomy,
close, and muggy, some people are troubled with rheumatic pains and
neuralgia, old wounds, and corns are painful, animals and birds are restless,
and drains and ditches give out an offensive smell:</p>

<p class='c021'>When rheumatic people complain of more than ordinary pains in the joints, it will
rain.</p>

<p class='c016'>If corns, wounds, and sores itch or ache more than usual, rain is to fall shortly.</p>

<p class='c017'>Also, from cloud and gloom, plants shut up their petals early:</p>

<p class='c021'>The <em>Convolvulus arvensis</em> (small bind-weed), <em>Anagallis arvensis</em> (scarlet pimpernel),
and <em>Calendula pluvialis</em> shut up their flowers before approaching rain. (The <em>pimpernel</em>
has been called the poor man’s weather-glass.)</p>

<p class='c017'>Dr. Jenner’s well-known lines are very good, as they contain references
to most of the natural prognostics. (See page <a href='#Page_110'>110</a>, General Prognostics.)</p>

<p class='c010'>It will be seen, however, later on, that the sayings about the rainbow,
distant hills, and whirling dust, though good prognostics, do not belong
to a depression.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the depression centre approaches still nearer, rain sets in and continues
till the barometer turns to rise. The passage of the trough is
often associated with a squall or heavy shower, commonly known as “a
clearing shower.” Immediately the air becomes cooler and loses the
former muggy sensation, and soon small patches of blue sky appear.</p>

<p class='c021'>When as much blue sky is seen as will make a Dutchman a jacket (or a sailor
breeches) the weather may be expected to clear up.</p>

<p class='c016'>A small cloudless place in the northeast horizon is regarded both by seamen and
landsmen as a certain precursor of fine weather or a clearing up.</p>

<p class='c017'>The steady rain breaks up into showers or cold squalls, which are
followed by hard detached cumulus or strato-cumulus till the sky becomes
blue again:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>When after a shower, the cirro-strati open up at the zenith, leaving broken or
ragged edges pointing upwards, and settle down gloomily and compactly on the horizon,
wind will follow, and will last for some time.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is a description of a clearing up before the windy portion of a
depression has passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the south of the depression near the outskirts, windy cirrus and
“mare’s tails” are observed, which indicate wind rather than rain, as
they are south of the rainy portion.</p>

<p class='c021'>The cloud called goat’s hair or the gray mare’s tails forebodes wind.</p>

      <div class='line'>Make lofty ships carry low sails.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The shift of the wind is different in the right-hand portion of the depression
to what it is in the left-hand portion. In the former, on its
first approach, the wind backs to south and falls very light to an almost
ominous calm. The first puffs or “paws” of wind give rise to a
noise in tree tops without much wind, and little eddies of dust, or to a
whistling of the wind indoors, which are all well-known signs of rain.
Then, as the depression passes along, the wind gradually veers to southwest
and west, with increasing strength. Hence,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the wind veers against the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trust it not, for back ’twill run.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>It is in the rain’s mouth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In the left-hand side of the depression the wind will back right round
from south through east to north and northwest. In the rear of the
depression on the left-hand side the wind blows from the northeast and
then north, when the clouds begin to break and the weather to clear.
When the depression has nearly passed away the wind in the rear draws
round to the northwest, and gradually abates, and the weather becomes
fine. Hence the saying:</p>

<p class='c021'>Do business with men when the wind is in the northwest.</p>

<p class='c017'>This bringing the finest weather is said to improve men’s tempers, as
opposed to the neuralgic and rheumatic sensations felt in front of a depression.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>WEDGE-SHAPED ISOBAR PROGNOSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Though the bulk of British weather is made up of cyclones and anticyclones,
there are two other distributions of pressure marked out by
wedge-shaped isobars and straight isobars respectively, which have
never before been described, but which are associated with many well-known
sayings. The chief interest in these prognostics consists in the
contrasts which they present to cyclone prognostics, as in many cases
they are associated with fine or dry weather, as opposed to the damp of
an approaching depression. We shall first describe the prognostics
which characterize the wedge-shaped area of high pressure that is frequently
formed between a retreating and an advancing depression, as it
is by far the most common.</p>

<p class='c010'>All these prognostics owe their value to the fact that as the new depression
comes on, rain may be expected. By reference to Fig. 3 it
will be seen that in the rear of the retreating depression the weather is
beautifully fine, of the sort of which we should say that it was “too
fine to last,” or, if it lasted a whole day, we should call it a “pet day.”</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.—Wedge-sharped Isobars.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>An unseasonably fine day in spring is called a pet day in Scotland. The fate of
pets they say awaits it, and they look for bad weather on the morrow.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the day the sun is burning hot:</p>

<p class='c021'>When the sun burns more than usual, rain may be expected.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the night white frost is formed, owing to calm radiation:</p>

<p class='c021'>A white frost never lasts more than three days; a long frost is a black frost.</p>

<p class='c016'>Frost suddenly following heavy rain seldom lasts long.</p>

<p class='c017'>As the day advances after a white frost, the air becomes dull from
the influence of the on-coming depression; whence the saying—</p>

<p class='c021'>When the frost gets into the air it will rain.</p>

<p class='c017'>During the very fine weather, on the east side of a wedge-shaped
area there is often great visibility with a cloudless sky:</p>

<p class='c021'>The further the sight the nearer the rain.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the Isle of Wight is seen from Brighton or Worthing, rain may be expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>When to the people about Arbrouth the Bell-Rock light is particularly brilliant,
rain is expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>About Cape Wrath and along that part of the coast when the Orkney Islands are
distinctly seen, a storm or a continuation of bad weather is prognosticated.</p>

<p class='c016'>When from Ardersier and the adjoining parish on the southeast side of the Moray
Firth the distant Ross-shire hills are distinctly seen in the morning rain is expected
that day.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the people in Eaglesham, in Renfrewshire, when the Kilpatrick hills appear
near a change to wet is looked for; but when they appear remote, dry weather will
continue.</p>

<p class='c016'>If the old moon embraces the new moon, stormy weather is foreboded.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Great confidence is placed in this old prognostic:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I saw the new moon late yestreen</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Wi’ the old moon in her arm,</div>
      <div class='line'>And if we gang to sea, master,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I fear we’ll come to harm.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The reason of “visibility” is uncertain; the old idea that it is due to
excess of vapor is certainly erroneous. The dry and wet bulb hygrometer
always indicates a considerable amount of dryness when it is remarked,
and Mr. Cruickshank has shown by long observation at Aberdeen that
visibility is greatest at the driest season of the year.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the extreme northwest edge of a depression there is often unusual
“refraction,” a well-known sign of rain. This seems to be due to the
cold air in the rear of a depression being much below the temperature
of the sea. If so, it is a sign of rain, for the reason that one depression
is usually followed soon by another, which also explains the saying—</p>

<p class='c021'>A norwester is not long in debt to a souwester.</p>

<p class='c017'>Refraction and visibility combined also explain the following curious
local prognostic:</p>

<p class='c021'>When Ailsa Craig is distinctly seen, and seems near at hand, the people of Cumbræ
look for change. When the weather is going to be finer it lies flat; but when rain is
coming it assumes the form of a mushroom.</p>

<p class='c017'>Ailsa Craig is an isolated rock standing in the Firth of Clyde, about
thirty miles from Cumbræ. It has a conical top, with precipitous sides,
so that in ordinary weather only the top is seen lying flat on the horizon;
but sometimes in the rear of a depression it appears lifted by refraction,
and the light encroaches at the edges, as is often seen with projecting
promontories, giving the whole a fanciful resemblance to a mushroom.
The prognostic is mistrusted by the inhabitants during frost, and we
have proved it by our own observation. On the west side of the wedge-shaped
area, as the new depression comes on, the blue sky gradually
assumes a dirty appearance, accompanied by a halo, and gathers into
cloud, and later on rain begins to fall; while in the southern portion
the rain is often preceded by strips of cirrus, either lying in the direction
of the wind, or sometimes at right angles to it:</p>

<p class='c021'>Cirrus at right angles to the wind is a sign of rain.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>STRAIGHT ISOBAR PROGNOSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Now we come to the consideration of some very interesting rain prognostics
associated with straight isobars. While those in a depression
are preceded by an almost ominous calm, and a dirty, murky sky, these
are associated with a hard sky and blustery wind, of which it would be
ordinarily remarked “that the wind keeps down the rain,” or “that
when the wind falls it will rain.” While also the prognostics which
precede cyclone rain hold good for the reason that they are seen in
front of the rainy portion, those associated with straight isobars hold
good because, though there is little rain actually with them, the area
which they cover to-day will probably be covered by a depression to-morrow—the
conditions being favorable for the passage of depressions.</p>

<p class='c010'>On turning to Fig. 4 it will be seen that while the pressure is high to
the south, it is generally low to the north, without any definite cyclonic
system, and that the isobars run straight nearly east and west.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
<img src='images/i_018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 4.—Straight Isobar Prognostics.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Near the high pressure the sky is blue, then as we approach the low
pressure feathery cirrus, or some form of windy sky, makes its appearance,
while a blustery wind whirls the dust, or blows the soot down;
and animals turn their tails to the wind to avoid its force on their faces:</p>

<p class='c021'>When chimneys smoke and soot falls, bad weather is at hand. The whistling of the
wind heard within doors denotes rain.</p>

<p class='c016'>When sheep, cattle, or horses turn their backs to the wind, it is a sign of rain.</p>

<p class='c017'>Getting still nearer the low pressure, the sky is found to be gathering
into hard stratus, at first with chinks between its masses, through
which divergent rays stream down under the sun, which is spoken of
as “the sun drawing water.” Sometimes, especially in winter, these
rays are lurid, and are referred to in the following prognostic:</p>

<p class='c021'>Along the north shore of the Solway, from Dumfries to Gretna, a lurid appearance
in the eastern or southeastern horizon, called from its direction “a Carlisle sky,” is
thought a sure sign of coming rain. They describe it as lurid and yet yellowish, and
the common saying is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Carle sky</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeps not the head dry.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>At the same time there is often great “visibility” with a hard overcast
sky, and moderately dry air, in which the stratus seems to play the
part of a sunshade, for as soon as the sun comes out the clearness of
distant objects diminishes. This visibility must not be confounded with
the visibility already described with a cloudless sky, which occurs with
wedge-shaped isobars. Simultaneously we often find “audibility.”</p>

<p class='c021'>If the noise of a steamer or railway train is heard at a great distance, rain is predicted.</p>

<p class='c017'>This distinctness of distant sounds must be carefully distinguished
from sounds which are not usually heard, being brought up by the wind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>coming from a rainy quarter. For instance, the whistle of a railway
train to the south of a house will not be usually heard with the normal
southwest wind of this country; but when the wind backs in front of a
depression to the south, then it will be heard, and although this will be
a good prognostic, still it is not true audibility.</p>

<p class='c021'>When people of Monzie (Perthshire) hear the sound of the waterfalls of Shaggie,
or the roar of the distant Turret clearly and loudly, a storm is expected; but if the
sound seems to recede from the ear till it is lost in the distance, and if the weather
be thick a change to fair may be looked for speedily.</p>

<p class='c016'>In Fortingall (Perthshire) if, in calm weather, the sound of the rapids on the Lyon
is distinctly heard, and if the sound descends with the stream, rainy weather is at
hand; but if the sound goes up the stream and dies away in the distance, it is an
omen of continued dry weather, or a clearing up if previously thick.</p>

<p class='c017'>The course of Turret and Lyon is from west to east.</p>

<p class='c010'>True “audibility” is best described by the saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A good hearing day is a sign of wet.</div>
      <div class='line'>Much sound in the air is a sign of rain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This last exactly conveys the kind of sound referred to. The reason
why audibility is produced is unknown, but the old idea that it is due
to excessive moisture in the air is certainly erroneous; in several instances
we have observed that the upper current of the wind appeared
to be moving much faster than the lower, and perhaps that may have
something to do with it. When the gradients are very steep, a little
rain sometimes falls with straight isobars, generally in light showers,
with a hard sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though as a matter of convenience we have described the sequence
of weather as we proceed from high to the low pressure, it must be
clearly understood that it does not represent the sequence of weather
to a single observer, but rather what the weather will be simultaneously
in different parts of the country; for instance, that if there are cirrus
clouds in London there may perhaps be a lurid sky in Edinburgh. The
prognostic value of all is due to the fact that a depression will soon
form which will probably extend over the whole country.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>ANTICYCLONE PROGNOSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Having spoken of cyclones, we shall now direct our attention to anticyclones.
In the daily weather charts we sometimes see but two or
three isobars, and these are a considerable distance apart, and extend
over a large area. The pressure is highest in the centre, and gradually
diminishes outwards. The air is calm and cold in the central area, but
on the outskirts the wind blows in the direction of the hands of a watch.
These are the special features of an anticyclone. The weather in an
anticyclone is almost the opposite of that in a depression; that in the
latter being wet and unsettled, while that in the former is usually settled
and fine, with more or less haze in the air. Another great difference is
that while depressions are generally rapid in their movements, anticyclones
are nearly stationary; and it is for this reason that they are associated
with “settled” fine weather. In the area of high pressure the
characteristic features are largely modified by what is termed “radiation”
weather, as determined by diurnal and seasonal variations; and
as the pressure is nearly stationary, these diurnal and seasonal variations
are the chief features of anticyclonic weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall now give the prognostics due to the variations in some detail,
Fig. 5. The sky being generally clear and the air calm, the temperature
is high in the day and low at night. In summer brilliant sun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>shine prevails during the day, and at night there is heavy dew, and in
low-lying places mist.</p>

<p class='c021'>Heavy dews in hot weather indicate a continuance of fair weather, and no dew
after a hot day foretells rain.</p>

<p class='c016'>If mist rises in low ground and soon vanish, expect fair weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thin, white, fleecy, broken mists, slowly ascending the sides of a mountain whose
top is uncovered, predicts a fair day.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>When the mist creeps up the hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fisher out and try your skill.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When in the morning the dew is heavy and remains long on the grass, when the fog
in the valleys is slowly dissipated and lingers on the hill-side, when the clouds seem
to be taking a higher place, and when a few loose cirro-strati float gently along,
serene weather may confidently be expected for the greater part of that day.</p>

<p class='c017'>These all refer to night radiation, mist being dispersed by the sun’s
rays. Fine, light, genial weather raises the spirits and exerts an enlivening
influence not only on human beings but also on animals, birds,
insects, &#38;c. Hence the saying:</p>

<p class='c021'>If larks fly high and sing long, expect fine weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>When sea birds fly out early and far to seaward, moderate winds and fair weather
may be expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>If rooks go far abroad it will be fine.</p>

<p class='c016'>Cranes soaring aloft and quietly in the air foreshow fair weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>If kites fly high, fine weather is at hand.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wild geese, wild geese, ganging out to sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>Good weather it will be.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When owls whoop much at night, expect fair weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>Bats, or flying mice, coming out of their holes quickly after sunset and sporting in
the open air premonstrates fair and calm weather.</p>

<p class='c016'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Chickweed expands its leaves boldly and fully when fine weather is to follow.</p>

<p class='c017'>In winter frost is generally prevalent in the central area of an anticyclone,
accompanied frequently by fog, which is most dense in the
neighborhood of large towns. This is all due to the radiation of calm
weather.</p>

<p class='c021'>White mist in winter indicates frost.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the evenings of autumn and spring vapor arising from a river is regarded as a
sure indication of coming frost.</p>

<p class='c017'>This comes from the air being colder than the water.</p>

<p class='c021'>When fires burn faster than usual, and with a blue flame, frosty weather may be
expected.</p>

<p class='c017'>This is caused by reduced temperature of the outer air making a better
draught in the chimney.</p>

<p class='c021'>In winter when the sound of the breakers on shore is unusually distinct, frost is indicated.</p>

<p class='c017'>These last two prognostics are explained by the fact that the atmosphere
is very dense and still in an anticyclone.</p>

<p class='c010'>In those places where fog does not form the sky will often be clear at
night, whence—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'>Clear moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Frost soon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>In winter when the moon’s horns are sharp and well defined, frost is expected.</p>

<p class='c017'>The wind in an anticyclone system blows in the direction of motion of
the hands of a watch, but slightly outwards, and as the anticyclone
is nearly always stationary, the wind blows from the same quarter for
several days together.</p>

<p class='c021'>When the wind turns from northeast to east and continues two days without
rain, and does not turn south the third day, nor rain the third day, it is likely to continue
northeast for eight or nine days, all fair, and then come to the south again.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>If the wind is northeast three days without rain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eight days will pass before south wind again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The wind is usually very light in force.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is said to be a sign of continued good weather when the wind so changes during
the day as to follow the sun.</p>

<p class='c016'>If wind follows sun’s course, expect fair weather.</p>

<p class='c017'>This “veering with the sun,” as it is called, is the ordinary diurnal
variation of the wind, which in this country is very obvious with the
shallow gradients of an anticyclone. At sea-side places in summer
very often “the wind is in by day and out by night,” which is the
equivalent of the land and sea breezes of the tropics. Like two preceding
prognostics, it is only in anticyclones that local currents of air,
probably due to unequal heating of sea and land, can override the
general circulation of the atmosphere in this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes in winter, on the southern side of the anticyclone, bitter
east winds, with a black-looking sky, will prevail for several days together,
when it may be truly said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>’Tis neither good for man nor beast.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes also the sky in this region will be covered with a uniform
stratus cloud, which is not of any great thickness, and when breaks
occur, the sun is seen to be shining brightly above.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the northeast side of the anticyclone in summer, light, cumulus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>clouds frequently form in the morning, gradually increase till after the
maximum temperature has passed, and then decrease and disappear
towards evening.</p>

      <div class='line'>Be sure no rain disturbs the summer day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When the cumulus clouds are smaller at sunset than they were at noon, expect fair
weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>Clouds small and round like a dapple gray with a north wind, fair weather for two
or three days.</p>

<p class='c017'>The cirrus cloud is usually seen on the outskirts of an anticyclone,
if in the front it gradually disappears, but if in the rear it is a sign that
there will be a change in the weather, hence:</p>

<p class='c021'>If cirrus clouds dissolve and appear to vanish, it is an indication of fine weather.</p>

<p class='c016'>If cirrus clouds form in fine weather with a falling barometer, it is almost sure to
rain.</p>

<p class='c016'>When, after a clear frost, long streaks of cirrus are seen with their ends bending towards
each other as they recede from the zenith, and when they point to the northeast,
a thaw and a southwest wind may be expected.</p>

<p class='c017'>Both these latter prognostics refer to a depression coming in and
“breaking up the weather” and the anticyclone.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c014'>We have endeavored in this paper to deal with such prognostics as
can be readily classified, but besides these there are many more, what
may be termed unclassified prognostics. Our object has been to show
the relation between certain prognostics and certain forms of isobars,
and by this means to assign them their proper value. It cannot be
doubted that if careful attention were given to the observation of the
aspect of the sky, the different forms of cloud and local signs, these
would prove, even in conjunction with a single barometer reading, of
great assistance in predicting the weather. Of course those persons
who live in the neighborhood of large towns labor under a great disadvantage,
as the sky has nearly always a dirty appearance, and is frequently
obscured by smoke. For this reason London is about the worst
place to reside in for studying the weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have only been able to give the rudiments of the new method of
considering prognostics, for the method is capable of great extension,
and we hope that we may succeed in interesting some of the Fellows
sufficiently to induce them to observe prognostics in conjunction with
the daily weather charts.</p>

<p class='c010'>In conclusion, we would venture to express our opinion that the observation
of local signs of weather ought to form a most important element
in all arrangements for telegraphic reporting for the purpose of
forecasts, and that the duty should be impressed upon the observers of
reporting at once important changes in the local and general signs of
the weather. Great attention should also be paid to the observation of
the forms and motion of clouds, and as considerable lack of knowledge
prevails, even on the part of good observers, regarding the different
forms and modifications of clouds, we are glad to see that the
meteorological office has already commenced systematic observations of
cirrus clouds. Telegraphic observers should be specially instructed in
cloud observations and prognostics by some one thoroughly well versed
in the subject, so that there may be strict uniformity among all the
observers, but we admit that the proposal presents serious difficulties
in the way of realization.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Theoretically, when the isobars are well defined we ought to be able
to write down the prognostics which might be visible, but practically
we cannot do so. Besides, there are sometimes cases of isobars which
have no well-defined shape, but with which thunder-storms or heavy
showers often occur. These, as is well known, do not affect the barometer,
but are abundantly forewarned by the commonest prognostics, and
as the rainfall is usually heavy in them the failure of the forecast
which omits to notice them is very conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c010'>The scope of this paper precludes us from entering into the complicated
question of the non-cyclonic rainfalls in this country. It will be
enough to state that the prognostics which precede them are rather
those associated with broken weather, such as bright sunrises or heavy
clouds banking up without the barometer falling, than the muggy, dirty
weather of a cyclone front. The warning they give is also much shorter,
rarely more than three or four hours, if so long.</p>

<p class='c017'>The result of this paper may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>The authors explain over one hundred prognostics by showing that
they make their appearance in definite positions relative to the areas of
high and low atmospheric pressure shown in synoptic charts. The
method adopted not only explains many that have not hitherto been accounted
for, but enables the failure as well as the success of any prognostic
to be traced by following the history of the weather of the day
on a synoptic chart. The forms discussed are cyclones, anticyclones,
wedge-shaped and straight isobars. The details of weather in the last
two are now described for the first time. They also point out that
prognostics will never be superseded for use at sea and other solitary
situations, and that prognostics can be usefully combined with charts
in synoptic forecasting, especially in certain classes of showers and
thunder-storms which do not affect the readings of the barometer.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c022'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c011'><em>DISCUSSION.</em></h3>

<p class='c014'>Dr. Tripe said that some of the Fellows might think the paper
hardly suitable for reading at a meeting or printing in the journal of a
scientific society, but many of them took an interest in such papers, because
they were comparatively simple. In reference to the table of solar
and lunar halos in connection with rainfall, it appeared that rain was
pretty sure to fall within three days after the occurrence of a lunar
halo, and to the extent of 80 per cent., as regards solar halos, on
the first or second day.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c022'><sup>[2]</sup></a> He considered visibility was a good prognostic,
and afforded a more certain indication of the speedy occurrence
of rain than even mare’s tails. What caused visibility was unknown
to him. The prediction of rain from damp walls depended chiefly on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the previous weather; a sudden change from cold to warm would have
the effect of making walls condense the moisture contained in the air
without approaching rain. The falling of soot down a chimney was,
he thought, hardly a good prognostic; it was caused to a great extent
by the direction and force of the wind, and also the angle at which the
wind struck the chimney-pot. He considered the paper a good one, and
a step in the right direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Marces said, with regard to visibility being a sign of rain, he had
himself observed on the borders of the Lake of Geneva, that if the
mountains on the opposite side of the lake could be seen very distinctly
on a cloudy day, rain was likely to fall within a short period. On such
occasions the coast appeared much nearer than usual. The late Professor
de la Rive, of Geneva, ascribed this phenomenon to the atmospheric
dust being hygrometric and becoming transparent in damp
weather from the moisture it absorbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Stanley remarked that solar and lunar halos depended upon the
moisture in the air, and that a sign of rain could be better assured by
reference to the hygrometers. He thought that fine weather in front
of a cyclone was due to increase of pressure, and therefore of temperature,
caused by the onward march of the cyclone. This increase of
temperature was known to render sound more audible, and by making
the air clearer distant objects became more visible. It was known
that condensed vapors disappeared under a slight increase of pressure,
just as, conversely, under the ordinary air-pump, vapors appeared on
a diminution of pressure. He considered that the fall of rain in the
centre of a cyclone was caused by the increase of pressure due to the
tangential action of the air in the cyclone. The straight isobars
described in the paper, were, he thought, in segments of a very large
cyclone, which was general in all large displacements of air.</p>

<p class='c010'>Captain Toynbee thought that the great clearness of the air experienced
when isobars took the wedge-shaped form, was due to the fact
that such isobars represented a ridge of high barometrical pressure,
which lay between two cyclonic systems, and that the high pressure of
the ridge was maintained by air which had previously risen in front of
the advancing cyclonic system, when it had lost most of its moisture,
and now came down as a dry, pure, clear, northwesterly wind. Hence
the clearness of the air was, where wedge-shaped isobars were being
experienced, a sign of rain, because it indicated the fact that a cyclonic
system would soon advance over the same position. This explanation
was based upon the Rev. W. Clement Ley’s theory of the motion of air
in cyclonic systems.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Scott thought that it might have been desirable to give the authorities
or sources from which some of the principal sayings had been
derived, in order to show which were general and which were of more
local import. Reference had also been made to the prevalence of bad
smells with a falling barometer, and to the fact that rheumatic affections
and neuralgia were felt especially at such a time; but no attempt
had been made to explain the connection of those phenomena. It was
a well-known fact that a sudden reduction of pressure, such as that experienced
by divers when they returned to the surface of the water,
produced neuralgic affections. The authors had described straight line
isobars and their accompanying prognostics, but only for west winds,
for pressure lowest in the north. He should be glad to see the list of
prognostics extended so as to include those for straight isobars with
east winds when the pressure was lowest in the south. With regard to
refraction being a prognostic of rain, in some cases it was a prognostic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>of easterly winds, and was recognized as such in the west of Cornwall.
In the past summer he had himself verified this latter statement on several
occasions at Scilly and the Land’s End. The authors, he thought,
spoke a little too strongly when they said the barometer gave no sign
of thunder-storms. The type of isobar which accompanied these was
well known; it exhibited small undulations or incipient bights representing
imperfectly formed secondary depressions. At the same time
he must say that no one yet, in Europe at least, had been able to forecast
correctly the amount of rain for a given day in a given place. The
probability of some rain could be recognized, but no attempt could be
made to estimate its amount. This was apparently owing to ignorance
of the conditions of the upper atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Dyason expressed an opinion that the formulaters of weather
prognostics in the past must have been color-blind, an affliction from
which he was not sure that the authors of the paper were exempt.
“Where are the scarlet, orange, green or gold harmonious, and the
general glow?” He had endeavored in a series of sketches of skies and
clouds to portray the colors as they presented themselves to his mind.
In relation to visibility he referred to the Lakes of Geneva and Lucerne,
quoting the lines used in the locality of Mont P</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Dyason exhibited a sketch of the Matterhorn taken south of Zermatt
during intense visibility. He did not admit “that London was a
bad place for skies;” those he now exhibited were sketched in a northwestern
suburb of the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c010'>Professor Archibald considered that some of the prognostics mentioned
in the paper required more explanation. For instance, it was stated that
candles burned with an unsteady light in damp weather, but no reason
was given why they should do so. One very good prognostic in use in
Scotland appeared to have been omitted, namely: “The northwest wind
is a gentleman, and goes to bed.” He would also like to know why
fires burned with a blue flame in frosty weather. He considered that
visibility was often a local phenomenon connected with temperature.
He had noticed intense visibility and a fog in juxtaposition on that very
day, when travelling from Tunbridge Wells to London.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Symons pointed out that although it might be useful to trace the
origin of some of the weather proverbs, it would be extremely difficult
and perhaps impossible, as some of them were ancient. With regard
to the connection between lunar halos and rainfall, he thought that it
would be curious, considering the large number of wet days in this
country, rain falling on an average every other day, if some of them did
not happen to follow lunar halos. Respecting doors and windows sticking
in damp weather, this was rather the result of existing damp than
a forecast of more damp to come; for if existing damp foretold coming
damp it was not easy to see how dry weather could ever occur. With
regard to visibility, he was glad the authors had referred to Mr. Cruickshank’s
observations at Aberdeen, extending over twenty-one years, and
Mr. Symons thought that much might be learned from a thorough discussion
of similar observations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Wilson directed attention to Professor Tyndall’s theory, that audibility
was due to the homogeneity of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. C. Harding thought that the paper would be useful to an isolated
observer, whose forecast was dependent upon his own observation. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>appeared to him that in classifying the prognostics, the authors of the
paper had rather begged the question—given a certain occurrence which
was admittedly a prognostic of bad weather; this seems to have been
consequently classed as belonging to the front half of a cyclonic disturbance.
He suggested that with each occurrence of the prognostic
in question it would be better to note the existing conditions of atmospheric
distribution, and, finally, to classify by actual observation. He
stated that the form of isobars described by the authors as wedge-shaped
had been referred to many years ago in various publications, by Captain
Toynbee, as a “ridge” of pressure. Some distinction should have
been made between the weather of anticyclone in summer and in winter,
as it differed materially. Audibility had been referred to as a sign
of bad weather; he might say that it was notorious in ballooning that
for a given distance sounds could be heard more distinctly than on the
earth, and in a recent ascent he had noticed that the shrill voices of
children were much more audible than the voices of grown persons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Abercromby, replying, said that Doctor Tripe’s analysis of halos was
interesting, but that if rain did not fall within twenty-four hours after a
halo, any rain after that would not be due to the cyclone which produced
the halo, but to a new one. Damp walls were certainly due to excess of
vapor, not to rapid changes of temperature. Soot was doubtless blown
down by wind, but when used as a prognostic it rather referred to soot
falling out of doors, and was to be attributed to excessive damp. Halos
were unquestionably due to the presence of a thin film of ice-formed cloud,
and not merely to the amount of moisture in the air. This ice film was
only formed in front of cyclones or thunder-storms, and for that reason was
a sign of rain. With regard to visibility alluded to by several speakers, he
could not admit that it was due to excessive moisture, for the hygrometer
showed that it was not so. He agreed with Captain Toynbee, so
far as believing that there was a descending current of dry, clear air
with a northwest wind on the front side of a “wedge,” but he doubted
if that was the whole explanation. In the centre of anticyclones there
was also a descending current of dry air, but no “visibility.” The
diagram of straight isobars was given for westerly winds, as that
type was by far the commonest. Like every other shape of isobars,
the details varied with the type of weather in which they occurred.
In an elementary paper it was considered inexpedient to go into so
much detail. In the case mentioned by Mr. Scott, isobars trending
east and west, but sloping towards the south, the same broad features
as given in the diagram would be reproduced, but with a harder sky
and an east or northeast wind. The prognostics would, however, be much
more likely to fail, for cyclones in the northerly or easterly types, to
which such isobars would belong, did not follow with the same regularity
as in the westerly type. The refraction, which was a prognostic of east
winds on the southwest of an anticyclone, was very different from the
refraction on the northwest edge of a cyclone, which portended a fresh
storm. The chief difference was the haziness of the horizon in the former
case as compared with its visibility in the latter. The latter kind was
hardly known on the south coast of England. He strongly suspected
that the condition common to both kinds was a relatively cool air over
a comparatively warm sea. The type of isobar which exhibited incipient
“bights” or imperfect secondaries, was doubtless that most frequently
associated with thunder-storms, but the kind of thunder-storms alluded
to in the paper as showing no trace on the isobars undoubtedly occurred.
Any reference to cloud or sky colors was intentionally omitted in this
paper, as also to prognostics relating to diurnal winds. Candles burned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>badly before rain, probably owing to a stagnant, damp air. Blue flame
was owing to the formation of carbonic oxide when a fire burned very
red on a frosty night. Doors and windows sticking in damp weather
indicated rain because damp preceded the rain area of a cyclone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The idea suggested by Mr. C. Harding, that because certain prognostics
were known to be associated with bad weather, therefore they
were classed as belonging to the front of a cyclone, was entirely erroneous,
and exactly opposite to what had been done. The method Mr.
Abercromby had adopted for the last twelve years had been, when he
observed a good example of any prognostic, to make a note and put it
by with the nearest synoptic chart for the day, or often with both the
preceding and succeeding charts. When a sufficient number had been
collected, the charts were examined, and the necessary deductions
drawn from them. Thus the charts were classified according to the
prognostics associated with them. The results of all these researches
had been embodied in the paper, and the important fact deduced was
that every portion of every shape of isobars had a characteristic
weather and appearance. The general fact of a “wedge” being associated
with fine weather had been noticed many years ago by Captain
Toynbee, but the details of weather in different portions, and their relations
to prognostics, had a considerable amount of novelty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Marriott said that it would be impossible to give the authorities
or sources from which all the sayings in the paper had been derived,
but the foot-note on page <a href='#Page_23'>23</a> contained a list of the works from which
the quotations had been made. The authors on the present occasion
had only dealt with certain classified prognostics; and this would explain
why many others had not been noticed. They hoped, however,
to deal with these in a future paper.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Bull.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If the bull leads the van in going to pasture, rain must be expected;
but if he is careless and allows the cows to precede him, the
weather will be uncertain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cats.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When cats sneeze it is a sign of rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cardinal point to which a cat turns and washes her face after
a rain shows the direction from which the wind will blow.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the cat is basking in the sun of February, it must go again to
the stove in March. (German.)</p>

<p class='c010'>When cats are snoring foul weather follows.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cats are washing themselves fair weather follows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cats with their tails up and hair apparently electrified indicate
approaching wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a sign of rain if the cat washes her head behind her ear.
(Old lady on Cape Cod.)</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Cats clean table-legs, tree-trunks, &#38;c., before storms.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a cat scratches itself, or scratches on a log or tree, it indicates
approaching rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>If sparks are seen when stroking a cat’s back, expect a change of

<p class='c010'>When cats lie on their head with mouth turned up expect a
storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cats purr and wash; dogs eat grass; sheep eagerly eat and turn
in the direction of the wind-point; oxen sniff the air, and swine
are restless before rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cats have the reputation of being weather-wise, an old notion
which has given rise to a most extensive folk-lore. It is almost
universally believed that good weather may be expected when the
cat washes herself, but bad when she licks her coat against the
grain, or washes her face over her ears, or sits with her tail to the
fire. As, too, the cat is supposed not only to have a knowledge of
the state of the weather, but a certain share in the arrangement of
it, it is considered by sailors to be most unwise to provoke a cat.
Hence they do not much like to see a cat on board at all, and when
one happens to be more frisky than usual they have a popular saying
that the cat has a gale of wind in her tail. A charm often resorted
to for raising a storm is to throw a cat overboard; but, according
to an Hungarian proverb, as a cat does not die in water its
paws disturb the surface; hence the flaws on the surface of the
water are named by sailors “cat’s-paws.” In the same way also
a large flurry on the water is a “cat’s-skin;” and in some parts of
England a popular name for the stormy northwest wind is the
“cat’s-nose.”</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Chipmunk.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>In cold and early winters the chipmunk is very abundant on the
south shore of Lake Superior, and are always housed for the winter
in October. In short and mild winters they are seen until the 1st
of December.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cattle.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When a storm threatens, if cattle go under trees, it will be a
shower; if they continue to feed, it will probably be a continuous
rain. (New England.)</p>

<p class='c010'>When cows fail their milk, expect stormy and cold weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cows bellow in the evening, expect snow that night.</p>

<p class='c010'>In Texas, when cattle hasten to timber, expect a “norther.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When a cow stops and shakes her foot, it indicates that there is
bad weather behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cows refuse to go to pasture in the morning, it will rain
before night.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cattle collect near the barn long before night and remain
near the barn till late in the morning, expect a severe winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Expect rain when cattle low and gaze at the sky.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Cattle are also said to foreshow rain when they lick their forefeet,
or lie on the right side, or scratch themselves more than they
usually do against posts or other objects.</p>

<p class='c010'>When cattle go out to pasture and lie down early in the day, it
indicates early rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Deer.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When deer are in gray coat in October, expect a severe winter.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Dogs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Dogs digging or making deep holes in the ground are said to indicate
rain thereby.</p>

<p class='c010'>If a dog howls when some one leaves the house it indicates rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>When a dog or cat eats grass in the morning it will certainly rain
before night.</p>

is about over.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Ground-hog.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If on Candlemas day (2d February) it is bright and clear, the
ground-hog will stay in its den, thus indicating that more snow and
cold are to come; but if it snows or rain he will creep out, as the
winter has ended. (German.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Goat.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>The goat will utter her peculiar cry before rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Hares.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Hares take to the open country before a snow-storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Hogs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Hogs pick and store straws, leaves, &#38;c., before cold weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hogs rubbing themselves in winter indicates an approaching
thaw.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><strong>Horse-hair.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If the hair of a horse grows long early, expect an early winter.</p>

respect restless and uneasy on the road.</p>

<p class='c010'>Horses and mules very lively without apparent cause indicate
cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>When horses assemble in the corner of a field, with heads to leeward,
expect rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Kine, when they assemble at one end of a field with their tails to
windward, often indicate rain or wind. During the dead calm before
a storm we may often see them extending their nostrils, with
the head upwards, snuffing the air; this prognostic has been
noticed of old by Virgil, and after him by Lord Bacon and others.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Mole.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If the mole dig his hole two feet and a half deep, expect a very
severe winter; if two feet deep, not so severe; if one foot deep, a
mild winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the moles throw up the earth, rain follows soon.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Noise.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Animals making unusual noise indicates change of weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Oxen and Sheep.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When oxen or sheep collect together as if they were seeking shelter,
a storm may be expected. (Apache Indians.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Pigs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Pigs uneasy, grunting, and huddling together, indicate cold.</p>

<p class='c010'>When pigs busy themselves gathering leaves and straw to make
a bed (in fall), expect a cold winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>When in winter pigs rub against the side of their pen, it is a sure
sign of a thaw.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the forward end of a pig’s melt is thicker than the other end,
the first part of winter will be the colder. If the latter end is
thicker, the last part of winter will be the colder.</p>

<p class='c010'>When pigs go about with sticks in their mouths, expect a
“norther” in Texas.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><strong>Prairie Dogs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rabbits seek the woods before a severe storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Rats and Mice.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Much noise made by rats and mice indicates rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Swine.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If swine be restless and grunt loudly, if they squeal and jerk
up their ears, there will be much wind. Whence the proverb,
“Pigs can see the wind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Swine make lairs on south side of shelter before cold weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Squirrels, etc.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When squirrels and small animals lay away a larger supply of
food than usual, it indicates that a long and severe winter will follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the spaniel sleeps it indicates rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Wolves.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Wolves always howl more before a storm; deer and elk come
down from the mountains at least two days before a storm.</p>

weather.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>If wolves howl in the evening, expect a “norther.” (Texas.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Mammals as Weather Prophets.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. C. C. Abbott showed that the autumnal habits of certain animals
that are popularly supposed to be indicative of the character of
the coming winter could not be depended upon, although by the majority
of people living in the country they were considered as sure indications
of what the winter would prove to be. Dr. Abbott had kept
a careful record, extending over twenty years, regarding the building
of winter houses by musk-rats, the storing of nuts by squirrels,
and other habits of these mammals, and had found that the habits
referred to, or their omission in certain autumns, bore no relation to
the character of the coming winter. (Trenton Nat. Hist. Soc.,
meeting February 13, 1883.)</p>

hooting and screaming of this bird deserve particular attention.
When an owl hoots or screeches, sitting on the top of a house or by
the side of a window, it is said to foretell death. The fact seems to
be this: The owl, as Virgil justly observes, is more noisy at the
change of weather, and as it often happens that patients with lingering
diseases die at the change of weather so the owl seems, by
a mistaken association of ideas, to forebode the calamity. Both the
screech owl and the howlet seem to be alluded to among the harmful
fowls in Spencer’s Fairy Queen.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div>STORM-PRESAGING CLOUDS.</div>
    <div class='c002'>[From the New York Herald.]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>An English meteorologist, the Hon. F. A. R. Russell, who for many
years has been a cloud observer, has recently given his conclusions as
to the predictive value of the upper clouds. As a celebrated example
of the clews given by cirrus clouds to coming weather he mentions that
the Rev. Mr. Ley, on a fine day, noticing certain indications of the
upper clouds in London, telegraphed from the strand to the meteorological
office ordering warnings of a heavy thunder-storm for four o’clock
that afternoon, which at the preannounced hour came crashing over the
metropolis. Mr. Russell’s researches lead him to the conviction that
the cirrus cloud is often a more timely monitor of approaching storms
than the barometer, and that the “bar or ribbed cirrus,” though somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>uncommon, is “at least equal in value to the falling barometer as
a danger signal.” He finds also that “detached patches of cirrus, like
little masses of wool or knotted feathers, in a clear sky and of unusual
figure, moving at more than the average rate, precede disturbances of
great magnitude.”</p>

<p class='c010'>From Aristotle’s time the value of cloud signs in storm and rain
prognostications has been recognized, but their interpretation has only
recently become possible, since the movement of storm centres over
wide areas has been systematically traced. The irregular motions of
the high clouds, perhaps more than their forms (presenting the appearance
of having been divided and torn by uprushing currents), indicate
dangerous cyclones. If the equatorial air current in which cyclones
are borne along is undisturbed by a cyclonic vortex, the clouds
floating in its higher strata would sail on it at a uniform rate. But if
we suppose that a storm is moving in the great current, the ascending
air in the storm’s centre is ceaselessly invading the cloud stratum above.
It is this uprushing air which divides the clouds. But as the interchange
between the surface and upper air in the cyclone centre tends to
retard the swift upper current which transports the cirriform clouds, the
motion of these clouds, both over the storm centre and far out in front
of it, must often be retarded. The very rapidly moving cirrus clouds
which Mr. Russell says precede great disturbances must precede them
at great distances from their centres—a fact which enhances their predictive
value and shows the importance of observing them systematically.
The terrible loss of life and property in the British gale of October
14, 1881, this writer thinks might have been less had the cloud
portents been duly watched and heeded, as the cirrus indications of the
day previous gave sufficient warning of the coming storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Anvil Clouds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Anvil-shaped clouds are very likely to be followed by a gale of
wind.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Appearances.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Soft-looking delicate clouds foretell fine weather with weak,
moderate, or light breezes. Hard edged, oily appearing clouds,
wind. A dark, gloomy, blue sky indicates wind; a bright, blue sky
clear fine weather. Generally the softer the clouds the less wind.
Small inky clouds foretell rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Assemblage of Clouds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If an assemblage of small clouds spread out or become thicker
and darker, expect rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Against the Wind.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If you see a cloud rise against the wind, when that cloud comes
up to you the wind will blow the same way that the cloud came,
and the same rule holds good of a clear place when all the sky is
equally thick except one clear edge. (Shepherd.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Bull’s Eye.</strong></p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Stratus.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Stratus or fall cloud is a fog or mist, so called from being strewed
along the ground, and from its consisting of particular kinds of
clouds, which fall at night-time to the ground. A stratus in the

<p class='c010'>If Sunday sunset is obscured, expect rain before Wednesday.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Salt Lake Valley.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>A horizontal streak or band of clouds immediately in front of the
mountains on the east side of Salt Lake valley is an indication of
rain within one or two days. When black clouds cover the western
horizon, rain will follow soon, and extend to the eastward over
the valley. (Observer at Salt Lake.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The number of dews before Easter will indicate the number of
hoar frosts to occur after Easter, and the number of dews to occur
in August.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Heavy Dew.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If there is a heavy dew and it soon dries, expect fine weather; if
it remains long on the grass, expect rain in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>Heavy dew indicates fair weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clouds without dew indicate rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there is a heavy dew it indicates fair weather; no dew indicates
rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Haying Season.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>In haying season, when there is no dew, it indicates rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much dew after a fair day indicates another fair day. A calm
and fair day followed by absence of dew indicates rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Midnight.</strong></p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Plentiful Dew.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If the dew lies on the grass plentifully after a fair day, it indicates
that the following day will be fair. If there is no dew and no
wind after a fair day, rain will follow.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Southerly Winds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>A heavy dew in the middle latitudes is said to indicate southerly
winds.</p>

<p class='c010'>A heavy dew with a south to east wind, fair—with a northwest
wind, rain. (New England.)</p>

  <h4 class='c026'>PROVERBS RELATING TO FISH.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c017'><strong>General.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Fishes in general, both in salt and fresh waters, are observed to
sport most and bite more eagerly against rain than at any other
time.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Black-fish.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Black-fish in schools indicate an approaching gale.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Blue-fish, pike, etc.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Blue-fish, pike, and other fish jump with head towards the point
where a storm is frowning.</p>

<p class='c010'>The approach of blue-fish to the Middle Atlantic coast is a
true indication of a shift of wind to the north within twenty-four
or thirty-six hours. The observer furnishing the above states
that he has not known this saying to have failed once in the past
twenty-five years, and assigns as a reason that in autumn all fish
go south, and the blue-fish, it appears, is able to anticipate this
change and approaches the coast, where it may strike the feed-fish
on their way south.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Clam-Beds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Air-bubbles over the clam-beds indicate rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Porpoises in harbor indicate coming storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cat-fish.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Fish swim up stream, and cat-fish jump out of water before rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the skin on the belly of the cat-fish is unusually thick, it indicates
a cold winter; if not, a mild winter will follow. (Negro.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cockles.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Cockles and most shell fish are observed against a tempest to
have gravel sticking hard unto their shells, as a providence of nature
to stay or poise themselves, and to help to weigh them down,
if raised from the bottom by surges.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cod-fish.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>The cod is said to take in ballast before a storm. It is said by
Sergeant McGillivry, Signal Corps, U. S. A., that there is one instance
of this saying well authenticated, as follows: A number of
cod were taken twelve hours before a severe gale, and it was found
that each had swallowed a number of small stones, some of the
stones weighing three or four ounces.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Crabs and Lobsters.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>The appearance of crabs and lobsters indicates that spring has
come, and that there will be no more freezing weather. Lake Ontario
black bass leave shoal water before a thunder-storm. This
has been observed twenty-four hours before storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><strong>Cuttles.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Cuttles, with their many legs, swimming on the top of the water

<p class='c017'><strong>Dolphins.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Dolphins, as well as porpoises, when they come about a ship, and
sport and gambol on the surface of the water, betoken a storm;
hence they are regarded as unlucky omens by sailors.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Eels.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If eels are very lively it is a sign of rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Equinox.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>In equinoctial storms fish bite the best before the sun crosses the
line.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Fish—Flies.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When fish jump up after flies expect rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Frog-fish.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Frog-fish crawling indicate rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Lake Trout.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>In the northern lakes of the United States white-fish and lake trout
leave reefs for deep water one month earlier in stormy falls
than in mild, calm falls, with little winds. (Chippewa Indians.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Lobsters and Craw-fish.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When lobsters or craw-fish heighten their holes about the surface
of the ground, it is a sign of approaching rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Moon.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Fish bite the best when the moon is in the tail.</p>

<p class='c010'>When pike lie on the bed of a stream quietly, expect rain or
wind.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Porpoises.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Porpoises, when they sport about ships and chase one another as
if in play, and indeed their being numerous on the surface of the
sea at any time, is rather a stormy sign. The same may be said of
dolphins and grampus. That the cause of these motions is some
electrical change in the air seems probable. Wilsford, in his Secrets
of Nature, tells us “Porpoises or sea-hogs when observed to sport
and chase one another about ships, expect then some stormy
weather.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Porpoises are said to swim in the direction from which the wind

of the above. The belief is explained as follows: 1st. If the
crescent will hold water, the month will be dry; if not, it will be wet.
2d. If the Indian hunter could hang his powder-horn on the crescent,
he did so and staid at home, because he knew that the woods would
be too dry to still hunt. If he could not hang his powder-horn
upon the crescent he put it on his shoulder and went hunting, because
he knew that the woods would be wet and that he could

<p class='c010'>When berries are plentiful in the hedge, on the May-bush, and
blackthorn, a hard winter may be expected.</p>

<p class='c010'>Berries in the hedges often forebode a hard winter, and severe
weather frequently occurs in seasons when they are particularly
plentiful on the May-bush and blackthorn. This rule is not, however,
without its exception. But, at all events, peculiarities of the
seasons have a wonderful influence on the quantities of berries, particularly
those of holly. The peculiarities of the seasons and their
influence on plants constitute a very curious subject of research;
it comprehends the whole doctrine of special blights, whereby only
certain tribes of plants are affected. Epidemics and epizoötics

<p class='c017'><strong>Color.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Since the colors and duration of twilight, especially at evening,
depend upon the amount of condensed vapor which the atmosphere
contains, these appearances should afford some indications of the
weather which may be expected to succeed. The following are
some of the rules which are relied upon by seamen: When after
sunset the western sky is of a whitish-yellow, and this tint extends
a great height, it is probable that it will rain during the night or
next day. Gaudy or unusual hues with hard, definitely outlined
clouds, foretell rain and probably wind. If the sun before setting
appears diffuse and of a brilliant white, it foretells storm. If it
sets in a sky slightly purple, the atmosphere near the zenith being
of a bright blue, we may rely upon fine weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Air Currents.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Currents of air change their course frequently, in the higher
regions of the air first, and are afterwards continued to the earth’s
surface; whence we can often foresee a change of wind by observing
the clouds. Both the strength of a coming gale and the point
from which it will blow may usually be determined by noticing the
velocity and direction of the clouds floating along in the upper currents.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Appetite.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When everything is eaten at the table, it indicates continued clear
weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Aurora.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>The aurora when very bright indicates approaching storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Barometer.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If it freezes and the barometer falls two or three tenths of an
inch, expect a thaw.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the weather gets warmer while the barometer is high and the
wind northeasterly, we may look for a sudden shift of wind to the
south. On the other hand, if the weather becomes colder while the
wind is southwesterly and the barometer low, we may look for a
sudden squall or a severe storm from the northwest, with a fall of
snow if it be winter time.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sudden rise of the barometer is very nearly as dangerous as a
sudden fall, because it shows that the level is unsteady. In an
ordinary gale the wind often blows hardest when the barometer is
just beginning to rise, directly after having been very low.</p>

<p class='c010'>A rapid rise of barometer indicates unsettled weather. A slow
movement the contrary, as likewise a steady barometer, which,
when continued, and with dryness, foretells very fine weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Bells.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Bells are heard at greater distances before rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Boots and Shoes.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Boots and shoes easy to pull on and off indicate dry weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Brick Walls.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Brick walls become damp before a rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Breeders.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Fine, warm days are called “weather breeders.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span><strong>Calm.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>A dead calm often precedes a violent gale, and sometimes the
calmest and clearest mornings in certain seasons are followed by a
blowing, showery day. Calms are forerunners of the hurricanes of
the West Indies and other tropical climes.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Camphor Gum.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Camphor gum is said to rise in alcohol before rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Clouds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If clouds drive up high from the south, expect a thaw.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Coals.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Coals covered with thick white ashes indicate snow in winter and
rain in summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Coals becoming alternately bright and dim indicate approaching
storms.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Coffee Bubbles.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When the bubbles of coffee collect in the centre of the cup, expect
fair weather. When they adhere to the cup, forming a ring, expect
rain. If the bubbles separate without assuming any fixed position,
expect changeable weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Corns.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Corns giving trouble indicate bad weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>When corns ache rain follows.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cream and Milk.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Cream and milk, when they turn sour in the night, often indicate
thereby that thunder-storms are about, and will probably shortly
take place.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Creeks and Springs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>In dry weather, when creeks and springs that have gone dry become
moist, or, as we may say, begin to sweat, it indicates approaching
rain. Many springs that have gone dry will give a good flow
of water just before rain. (J. E. Walter, Leavenworth, Kans.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Dandelion.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When the dandelions bloom early in the spring there will be a
short season. When they bloom late expect a dry summer.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Dreams.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Dreams of a hurrying and frightful nature and imperfect sleep,
are frequent indications that the weather is changed or about to
change. Many persons experience these nocturnal symptoms on
a change of wind, particularly when it becomes east. In all these
cases the effect seems to be produced immediately on the nervous
system, and through it on the stomach, so that the stomach shall
again react on the sensorium. The symptoms are enhanced by a
full stomach and other sources of indigestion. (Forster.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Dust.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Dust rising in dry weather is a sign of approaching change.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Ears.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Ringing in the ear at night indicates a change of wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ears, when there is a tingling noise, or what is called a singing
in them, afford thereby a sign of a change of weather, not simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of rain, as has been said, but of barometrical pressure in general.
The sudden increase of pressure, like the descent from high mountains,
or from balloons, causes in many persons a temporary deafness
and roaring in the ears. A sudden fall of the barometer affects
also the ears, but in a different manner, like mounting a high hill.
(Forster.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Noises in the ears are frequently precursors of marked atmospheric
changes.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Eclipse Weather.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Eclipse weather is a popular term in the south of England for
the weather following an eclipse of the sun or moon, and it is vulgarly
esteemed tempestuous and not to be depended on by the husbandman.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Epidemics.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Epidemics are disorders of health brought on by atmospherical
influence; and modern discoveries have shown how much most
prevailing diseases partake of an epidemical nature. Scarlet fever,
typhus, the plague, and indeed most diseases of this sort, are now
considered epidemical. It would seem that there is a most immediate
connection between the peculiar state of the air and the
kind of disorders which might be thereby excited. For it may be
observed that, even of those disorders which are not generally admitted
to be contagious, one particular kind will prevail for a long
time. Thus, in winter, the different symptoms of that state of body
which we call a cold, appear in some measure to prevail and vary
together, so that it is common to hear people talk of the fashionable
complaint. Coughs, for a while, are the prevailing symptoms;
then sore throats are the most common. It is in spring that certain
kinds of cutaneous eruptions usually appear, and in autumn that those
irregularities in the functions of the digestive viscera called cholera
morbus, &#38;c., happen, and which have been erroneously attributed to
eating much fruit. On the other hand, it cannot be considered that
atmospheric peculiarities alone produce epidemic and other complaints,
which must be regarded as having a compound origin, and
as resulting from the operation of peculiar states of the atmosphere
on persons of particular states of constitution, otherwise all persons
would be affected, which is contrary to experience. There are,
probably, innumerable varieties of temperament, of general habits of
life, and of pre-existing diseases, which in different subjects vary
the effects of the air. And many persons perhaps enjoy a state of
health and perfect action, which may be capable of resisting its
evil influence altogether. It would perhaps be productive of useful
results, if physicians of extensive practice would make accurate meteorological
registers during the prevalence of any epidemic or
contagious disorders. (Forster’s Encyclopædia of Natural Phenomena.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Epizootic.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Epizootic is a name for epidemic disorders occurring among animals,
of which we have many and various instances on record. The
state of the electrometer and other meteorological instruments should
be carefully examined during the prevalence of such pestilence.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Elder Bush.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>A number of superstitions may be traced back to the former connection
of the elder bush with the goddess. Witches were thought
to produce bad weather by stirring water with branches of elder.</p>

      <div class='line'>Last night I saw St. Elmo’s stars,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With their glimmering lanterns all at play</div>
      <div class='line'>On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And I knew we should have foul weather that day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><strong>Fire.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If the fire burns unusually fierce and bright in winter, there will
be frost and clear weather; if the fire burns dull, expect damp and
rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fire always burns brighter and throws out more heat just before
a storm, and is hotter during a storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Blacksmiths always select a stormy day in which to perform
work requiring extra heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>A fire hard to kindle indicates bad weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the fire crackles and crackles lightly, it is said to be treading
snow. (Old woman.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Floors.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Floors saturated with oil become very damp just before rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Fog Smoke.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When with hanging fog smoke rises vertically, rain follows.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Gale.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If, during the absence of wind, the surface of the sea becomes
agitated by a long, rolling swell, a gale may be expected. This
is well known to seamen.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Lamps, from the manner in which they burn, forebode weather.
Before rain they burn less bright, the flame snaps and crackles, and
a sort of fungous excrescence grows from the wicks, which Virgil
was mindful to put among his prognostics of rain and wind. From
this indicatorial property of the burning lights arose many superstitions
relating to them, as the blue color of the flame being a sign
of ghost and death, and so on, of which the following explanation is
already offered in the Perennial Calendar:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Numerous were the omens attached by credulous persons in former
days to the manner in which candles burnt, and particularly
to their flames. When they burned blue, it was accounted ill luck,
or else that some ghostly apparition was announced. Now when the
brain and nervous system are in a certain state peculiarly favorable
to spectral illusions, the imagination may easily color the flame of
a candle, without its really changing its tint; just as, in fevers,
people see spots of color on the wall, or imagine insects on the bedclothes.
For the same morbid condition of the animal system which
may cause persons to see the spectral prognostic, would in this case
cause them to behold the subsequent phantom, and thus the omen
and its awful consequence would be viewed together to the support of
superstition. Besides this, the particular mode of burning observed
in the wicks of lamps and candles is really found to be caused
by atmospherical peculiarities, and is a sure sign of rain.” (Forster’s
Encyclopædia of Natural Phenomena.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Light.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Refractions of light of any remarkable kind frequently forebode
rain, sometimes storms; at sea the knowledge of this is very useful.
Circles around the sun and moon, mock suns, and other phenomena
of this kind, together with the unusual elevation of distant coasts,
masts of ships, &#38;c., particularly when the refracted images are
inverted, are known to be frequent foreboders of stormy weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Night Clearing.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When oak trees bend in January, good crops may be expected.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Ocean.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>There are various prognostics deducible from the appearance of
the ocean. When the surface of the sea is rough without any wind
blowing at the time, expect a gale before long; for the wind already
blowing in some distant part of the ocean is the cause of the swell
imparted to the sea.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Pavements.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If pavements appear rusty or if stoves or iron or steel rust during
the night, rain may be expected soon.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Pipes.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Pipes for smoking tobacco become indicative of the state of the

denser and more powerful, it often forebodes rain and wind.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Rain.</strong></p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Smoke.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Smoke frequently indicates the state of the air. A person being
accustomed to take his pipe early in the morning will have occasion
to observe that when the smoke hangs a long while in the air,
and scents the place around where he has been smoking, a good
hunting day always follows. (Forster.)</p>

<p class='c010'>Smoke falling to the ground indicates rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Smoke ascending indicates clear weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>When smoke rises from the bottom lands and goes to the mountain,
expect an early winter. (Apache Indians.)</p>

<p class='c010'>When the sun presses the smoke out of chimneys, foul weather

<p class='c010'>When the smoke in clear weather rises vertically from the chimney,
the weather will remain clear.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Snow.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If snow falls in flakes which increase in size, expect a thaw.</p>

<p class='c010'>Distant sounds heard with distinctness during the day indicate
rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Stones.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Quarries of stone and slate indicate rain by a moist exudation
from the stones. This seems analogous to the dampness on stones,
stone steps, and ornaments, both of stone and of metal, before rain
and in damp weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>Stones sweating in the afternoon, the springs running flusher

<p class='c010'>Abundance depends upon sour milk; meaning that thunder-storms
aid crops.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thunder-storms almost always occur when the weather is hot for
the season; they are generally caused by a cold wind coming over
a place where the air is much heated. They do not cool the air; it
is the wind that brings them which makes the weather cooler. If
a thunder-storm comes up from the east, the weather will not be
cooler after it. This will not happen till another storm comes up
from the west. Thunder-storms are more violent the greater the
difference of temperature between the two currents of wind which
produce them.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Toothache.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Toothache is often a forerunner of some change of weather, like
other pains, and particularly that species which depends on inflammation
of a diseased socket or gum. In certain kinds of weather,
and particularly before rain or showers, decayed teeth and diseased
gums are very uneasy, and the pain often ceases when the rain begins
to fall. The periods of that sort of toothache which depends
on the exposure of the nerve in the cavity of the tooth seem to
exist independently of any particular weather, and occur most frequently
during the night, when the patient first gets warm in bed.
The progress of this sort of toothache is often as follows: The pain
after awhile becomes continuous instead of being periodical, and
by degrees subsides, but the socket then and ultimately the gum
become diseased, and are thence liable to be affected by the state
of the weather above described. (Forster’s Encyclopædia of Natural
Phenomena.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Tortoises.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Tortoises creep deep into the ground so as to completely conceal

<p class='c017'><strong>Winter Storms.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>In winter, after the prevalence of easterly winds, if the barometer
begins to fall and the thermometer to rise, a gale which commences
to blow from the southeast will veer to southwest, while
the barometer falls constantly. As soon as the wind passes the
southwest point the barometer begins to rise, a heavy shower of
rain falls, and a strong west-northwest or northwest wind may follow,
after which the sky clears and the weather becomes colder.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Winter Storm.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>If in winter the barometer rises very high, and a thick fog sets
in, it is a sure sign that the southwest and northeast winds are “fighting
each other.” Neither of them can make head against the other,
and there is a calm, but there is a great danger of such a state or
things being followed by a bad gale.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The following poems are, perhaps, more curious than interesting.
They afford, however, some idea of the superstitious dread with
which the advent of Christmas day must have been regarded in
these early times, not merely by the vulgar, but by all classes of our
forefathers, for the Francis Moores and Raphaels of the fifteenth
century found even kings willing believers in their extravagant
predictions. From the allusions in each verse of the first poem to
the risks that those who steal subject themselves to, one would almost
suppose thieving to have been the fashionable vice of the age,
practiced alike by both rich and poor, and that there was great need
of such injunctions against it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Both of these poems are from the same Harleian MS. in the British
Museum (No. 2252, fols. 153–4). Christmas with the poets. London.

<p class='c017'><strong>East Wind.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>A change of wind, particularly a change from any other quarter
to east, makes most people feel uncomfortable, and produces headaches
in persons who are subject to them. Similar changes have
the most violent effects when they happen about the new or full
moon. It is difficult to ascertain in what degree the directions and
changes of wind are under the influence of electricity, but there are
many circumstances which would incline one to believe that these
changes are dependent on some similar principle to that which
causes atmospheric diseases in the human body, for certain winds,
as well as certain changes of wind, are known to produce epidemics
in many countries where violent atmospherical complaints prevail;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and in every country of the world I believe the east wind is
almost proverbially unhealthy. Casual changes to east produce
headache and nervous complaints, and a long-continued wind from
that quarter produces an unwholesome season. Another curious
thing is, that with east winds good astronomical observations cannot
be made, the luminous objects seeming to dance or wave about
in the field of the telescope. (Atmospheric Phenomena—Forster.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Shooting Stars a Prognostic of Bad Weather.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>The connection between shooting stars and bad weather, mentioned
by many ancient writers, will appear probable if we consider
certain facts established in the domain of modern science.
Of all the various theories advanced to explain this startling phenomenon
(termed meteor, fire-ball, shooting-star, moon-stone, sun-stone),
that seems to be the most probable which considers them
planetary bodies of very small size, circulating in an orbit round
the sun, as our earth, and getting into that of the latter, entangled
by her attraction, which occasionally brings down some of them
upon her surface. Numerous planetary bodies, called Ceres, Pallas,
&#38;c., exist between Mars and Jupiter, and similar bodies of smaller
dimensions may exist between the earth and its neighbors in the
solar system.</p>

<p class='c010'>Periodicy is a great fact in cosmical arrangements, and this phenomenon
of shooting stars, &#38;c., is strikingly periodical. Induced,
apparently, by certain popular weather maxims among the French,
M. C. St. Claire Deville has investigated the subject, and his conclusions
are positive as to the “perturbations of the earth’s temperature,”
coincident with the phenomenon as noticed from time
immemorial in about the first fortnight of February, May, August,
and November. M. Deville even ventures upon general conclusions
from the fact. He says: “Do not all these considerations
almost necessarily lead us to infer the influence of these critical periods,
by their sudden variations of temperature, not only on the
health of the vegetable creation, but that of the human race?
Should we not examine the registers of hospitals, to see if certain
diseases are not more frequent on certain days of certain years?
Can we not even go back to the past and see, in the history and
chronicles of past ages, if there are some traces of periodicy in certain
great perturbations in the health of nations like the two invasions
of cholera, which perhaps by chance occurred in 1832 and in
1849, about the center of the two critical periods, and which came
from the north like the aurora borealis, since it seems, also, that it
is these great atmospheric waves that propagate the perturbations
of temperature?” In confirmation of this view we may notice the
cattle plague, and the cholera still hovering over us and likely to
recommence its ravages.</p>

<p class='c010'>Professor Erman, of Berlin, writing to Arago, in 1840, said that
“the two swarms or currents of asteroids (planetary bodies) which
the earth meets on the ecliptic, respectively, about the 10th of August
and the 13th of November, annually intervene between the earth
and the sun, the first in the days between the 5th and 11th of February,
the second from the 10th to 15th of May. Each of these
conjunctions annually causes at those dates a very remarkable extinction
of the heating ray of the sun, and thereby lowers the temperature
at all points of the surface of the globe.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>With respect to the November display of the phenomenon, it appears
that its maximum was in 1799 and in 1833. Since then it has
almost entirely ceased, but according to the prediction of Olbers it
will resume the ascendant in 1867. Humboldt and others have reported
on these displays, but that of the night of the 12th and 13th
of November, 1833, in the United States, as described by Olmstead,
needs only to be mentioned for our present purpose. No less than
300,000 masses, forming parts of the solar system, passed through
that part of our terrestrial atmosphere which was visible at Boston,
Mass.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was supposed that they were only stopped in the atmosphere
and prevented from reaching the earth by transferring their motion
to columns of air, large volumes of which they would suddenly and
violently displace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was remarked that the state of the weather and the condition
of the seasons following this meteoric shower were just such as
might have been anticipated from these disturbing circumstances
of the atmospheric equilibrium.”</p>

<p class='c010'>M. C. Gravier believes that meteors show the direction of the
coming wind; that their slow motion foretells a calm to ensue, or to
continue if it exists; in fact, he says they are our weather-cocks
and anemometers in the upper regions of the sky. He predicts that
the rest of the present year (1866) will be more dry than wet, and
the temperature above the average.</p>

<p class='c010'>Our object in this article is merely to draw attention to the critical
periods. It is obvious that if the passage of these meteors take
place by day we cannot see them, so that their non-appearance is no
reason why we should not be on our guard. From a list of storms
obligingly given us by the meteorologic office as having in past years
occurred at or about some of the periods we have named, and from
our own investigations, we believe that the subject is worthy of attention,
suggestive of caution at those critical periods, and altogether
deserving a more lengthy consideration than we can give it
in our limited space on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the great Barbadoes hurricane, August 10, 1831, fiery
meteors fell perpendicularly from a vast height. The correspondence
of the date, August 10th, is striking, and all are familiar with
the great “November Atmospheric Wave,” and its storms, especially
the great Crimean hurricane of disastrous memory (November
14, 1855). (Manual of Weathercasts, by Andrew Steinmetz.)</p>

<p class='c010'>The following interesting report relative to weather prognostics
of the Zuñi Indians was furnished by Mr. G. H. Cushing, assistant

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: I have the honor to submit herewith a few hastily-prepared
statements from my notes relative to the weather prognostics,
proverbs, &#38;c., of the Zuñi Indians:</p>

<p class='c010'>With these Indians the study of weather, both from practical
and superstitious standpoints, has been the result of necessity, the
growth of generations. It is therefore no matter of surprise that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the accompanying questions penetrate a rich domain with them of
research.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed, nothing short of a moderately lengthy treatise would do
the subject, which is withal popularly a most interesting one,
justice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Zuñi worship, like that of the ancient Greeks, relates principally
to this life.</p>

<p class='c010'>To this life water is considered the greatest of necessities and
blessings. Hence, rain, the clouds, springs, and all beings, things,
and phenomena related to them, are regarded as sacred. A better
understanding of this may be gleaned from the fact that in Zuñi
mythology the sky and the celestial bodies, many terrestrial objects,
and all phenomena of either, are regarded not less than all organized
beings as animate and conscious existences, the whole, including
man, being denominated <em>á hâ i</em>, or, The Beings. The greater
number of the latter are included under two great classes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. Kia-pin = á-hâ-i; and</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Kiä-shëm = á-hâ-i; the former signifying—</div>
      <div class='line'>1. Beings (belonging) <em>to</em> water, and the latter,</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Beings of the water.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>These <em>beings</em>, as above explained, include all <em>phenomena</em> or <em>objects</em>
connected with water, are supposed to control greatly the
weather, &#38;c.; hence the sayings relative to them and their influence
are legion.</p>

<p class='c010'>I have selected only a few of the principal of these, illustrative
merely of the questions which I find in General Hazen’s blank, regretting
that lack of time does not permit of a more exhaustive
treatment of his subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>In order that a few examples of the original Zuñi may be given
with the English renditions, I have answered the questions on a
separate piece of paper, indicating them by their number, as given
in General Hazen’s blank.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>1. The Sun.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“Yä to k’ia kiá kwap, i lo na kia ná, thli to nì ä hi ha.” (When
the sun is in his house (i. e., in a halo or circle) cloud it will, rain
will come soon.)</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yä to k’ia kwa k’ets a nam hortil k wa tâp, i tchi tin gä mu k’ia
ni ha, thli te kwa ni k’ia ná.” (When the sun sets unhappily (with
a haze-veiled face) then will the morning be angry with wind, storm,
and sand.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>2. The Moon.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>The moon, being a deity of the lives of men, does not belong to
the “<em>k’iä she ma hâi</em>;” hence the proverbs relative to her, the legion,
have little connection with weather prognostics. Two, however,
are very often repeated: Yä o non kia kwop, í lo na kia ná, thli to
kiaw i a ni ha; meaning, the moon, if in house be, cloud it will, rain
soon will come. Yä o non an no pon i shi la a kiap (the moon, her
face, if red be), kiä shë ma an te peie á (of water speaks she). The
changes in the moon indicate rather changes in the affairs of men
than in weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>3. The Stars.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>With the exception of six of the stars, viz: of the north, of the
west, of the south, of the morning, of the evening, of the zenith,
and of the lower regions (or horizon), the smaller celestial bodies relate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>also more to the affairs of men than to the weather. These six
are spoken of as are the sun and moon. There is, however, one
proverb which differs from those of the latter: Morgä tchu we in
sha na í mup, a li hortel té k’ia na. The stars sit still if they do (the
times) to be pleasant are. (When the stars sit still the times are to
be pleasant).</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>4. The Rainbow.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>A mi to lan u ha í ton illi; thli to i peyu á. (The rainbow has but
a bad character: she ever commands the rains to cease.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>5. The Fogs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Shi wai a horthl yëil la ke’a á pei ni up, té tsï ti i há. (When the
mist rolls down from the mountains, cold will it be.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>6. The Dew.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“When the dew is seen shining on the leaves, So ho! the mist
rolled down from the mountains last night, &#38;c.” (See proverbs relating
to fog.)</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>7. The Clouds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“When the clouds rise in terraces of white, soon will the country
of the corn-priests be pierced with the arrows of rain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the clouds rise in balls of blue mist from the horizon,
snow will soon whiten the country of the corn-priests.”</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>8. The Frost.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>With the coming of the frost grows the corn old.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>9. The Snow.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“If much snow be spread on the mountains in winter, the season
of planting will be made blue with verdure.”</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>10. The Rain.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“With the north rain leaves the harvest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The west rain, it comes from the world of waters to moisten the
home of the Shi wi (Zuñi).</p>

<p class='c010'>The south rain brings with it the beautiful odors of the hand of
everlasting summer and brightens the leaves of growing things.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the first thunder the Beloved (gods of rain) open their portals.</p>

<p class='c010'>It first thunders in the north: Aha! the bear has stretched his
left leg in his winter bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It first thunders in the west: Aha! the bear has stretched his left
arm in his winter bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It first thunders in the south: Aha! the bear has stretched his
right leg in his winter bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It first thunders in the east: Aha! the bear has stretched his
right arm, and comes forth, and then winter is over.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>12. The Winds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Wind from the north, cold and snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind from the western rim of the northland, snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind from the world of waters, clouds.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Wind from the southern rim of the world of waters, rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind from the land of the beautiful red, lovely odors, and rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind from the wooded cañons, rain and mist-clouds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind from the land of day it is the breath of health, and brings
the days of long life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Winds from the lands of cold, the rain before which flees the
harvest. Winds from the lands of cold, the fruit of ice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Winds from the right hand of the west is the breath of the god of
sand-clouds.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>13. Zoothistic Prognostics.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>I am compelled to leave this department, from want of detailed
notes, almost untouched, although there is scarcely an action of the
animals without its interpretation, either relative to weather or to
the affairs of men.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>14. Bats.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Bats who speak flying, tell of rain for to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>15. Birds.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When chimney swallows circle and call, they speak of rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the bluebirds twitter and sing, they call to one another of
rain.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the summer birds take their flight, goes the summer with
them.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>16. Frogs.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When the frogs warble, they herald the rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>17. Butterfly.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>When the butterfly comes, comes also the summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the flowers dry up, the birds of summer flee. See also

<p class='c010'>18. “When the locks of the Navajos grow damp in the scalp-house,
surely it will rain.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The seasons in Zuñi are only three—spring, summer, and winter.
They are supposed to result from the change of weather and the
will of the sun; hence are themselves prognosticated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The months are lunar, and there are no days of the Christian
week, save Sunday, when the Indians cannot trade, and which for
this reason they know of.</p>

<p class='c010'>Relative to proverbs of the months and seasons, I can only say
there are many, but, as in the case with other matters above alluded
to, they are rather relative to the affairs of life (mostly sacred obligations
and observances) than to weather and agricultural operations.</p>

<p class='c017'>INSTRUMENTAL AND OTHER LOCAL INDICATIONS OF APPROACHING
STORMS.</p>

<p class='c010'>[Compiled from reports made to the Chief Signal Officer by observers of the Signal
Service, U. S. A.]</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Albany, N. Y.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Storms set in with southerly winds, and are always preceded by
falling barometer, and usually by falling temperature, with nimbus
or cumulo-stratus clouds.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Alpena, Mich.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Cirrus, cirro-cumulus or cirro-stratus clouds in upper, and a dull
haze in lower atmosphere. Lower winds from westerly direction,
falling barometer and rising temperature.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Atlantic City, N. J.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Coronas and halos; prevalent haziness in lower atmosphere;
cirro-stratus clouds; unusual amount of humidity; stationary
barometer occurring after either a considerable rise or fall of the
mercury; backing winds.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Augusta, Ga.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly falling barometer, with rising temperature, and wind from
the east or southeast, usually indicates rain, which continues until
wind veers to the west or northwest; cirro-stratus clouds precede
wind and rain, and are frequently noted from one to three days in
advance.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Baltimore, Md.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>General storms by very high barometer, dense haze, light, variable
winds from east or northeast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southeast and southwest storms preceded by high temperature,
low barometer, and brisk northwest winds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Local storms preceded by unusually high temperature, cumulus
clouds, and rapidly falling barometer.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Fort Benton, Montana Ter.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Wind storms, preceded by low barometer, low humidity, cirrus
or cumulus clouds, with wind from west or southwest, generally
the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rain, preceded by cumulo-stratus clouds, with wind from west to
north and northeast, barometer moderately low, remaining stationary
during storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Snow-storm, same condition as rain, except that barometer falls
and stratus clouds prevail.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span><strong>Bismarck, Dak.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rapidly falling barometer, rising temperature, and light southerly
winds indicate rain or snow, according to season of year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer, rising temperature, with wind from northeast
or east, indicate snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fine cirrus and cirro-stratus, floating low, presage wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Haze in night or early morning, or cumulus clouds, sharp and
well defined, moving from west or southwest, indicate fair weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>When snow is falling, and the wind backs from east to north,
with decreasing velocity, clear weather may be expected.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Breckenridge, Minn.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Sudden movement of barometer in either direction, rising temperature,
light cumulus clouds, with northwest wind, precede
wind-storms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sudden depression of barometer, rising temperature, cumulus or
cumulo-stratus clouds, with southeast wind, precede rain or snow
storms.</p>

<p class='c010'>An approaching storm is indicated by unusual clearness of the
atmosphere, and frequently by lunar halos.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Buffalo, N. Y.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rising barometer, with comparatively clear sky, mild temperature
and light to fresh winds from west to southwest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Light cirrus or cirro-stratus clouds move from the west, apparently
very high in the atmosphere; humidity and wind decrease,
and occasionally a calm ensues. This is followed by light winds
from northeast, east, or southeast. Barometer begins to fall, and
temperature to rise slowly; humidity increases steadily; cumulus
clouds appear, moving slowly from west or southwest, and are soon
followed by cumulo-stratus; wind increases in velocity, and shortly
before precipitation occurs a dense white vapor, resembling haze,
and moving with the surface current, gradually covers the whole
sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind-storms are preceded by unusually rapid barometric depression,
increase in temperature and humidity, stratus or cumulo-stratus
clouds, with southwest winds. Water at the head of Lake Erie
rises in advance of the storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Burlington, Vt.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rapidly falling barometer, rising temperature, and cumulo-stratus
or stratus clouds, with wind from south or southwest.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cairo, Ill.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer, rising temperature, stratus or cumulo-stratus,
with wind from the south or southwest, precede rain; wind-storms
are preceded by rising barometer, falling temperature, and cirro-stratus
clouds, with brisk wind from west or northwest. Well-defined
lunar halos are followed by rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cape Henry, Va.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Northeast storms are preceded by rapidly rising barometer and
upper clouds (usually cirrus), moving rapidly from northeast in long
white sheets changing to stratus in short time, and covering the
whole sky.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Southeast storms are preceded by rapidly falling barometer, unusually
low humidity and variable southwest winds. Heavy ocean-swell
in advance of storm and from same direction in which storm
is advancing.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cape Hatteras, N. C.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Winter rain storms preceded by rapidly falling barometer and
heavy cirro-stratus clouds, with wind from southeast or southwest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Upper clouds moving from southwest indicate rain, but if from
west or northwest, fair weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>Heavy ocean-swell from southeast indicates rain from that direction.
Wind storms preceded by dense haze, rapidly falling barometer,
and rising temperature with southerly winds and with
northerly winds, rising barometer, and falling temperature with
low humidity.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cape May, N. J.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Easterly storms are generally preceded from twelve to twenty-four
hours by an unusually clear atmosphere, with high barometer and
temperature. Light winds prevail and mirage in various forms, but
more particularly the variety known as “loom,” which enlarges distant
objects in such a manner as to render distance very deceptive.
The sea comes in with a long, heavy, easterly, ground swell, and a
decided increase occurs in the rise of the tides. An unusual twinkling
of stars is observed, and a larger number of them are visible,
extending nearly to the horizon. The first clouds are generally
cirrus, from the west or southwest, followed often by haze, which
gradually thickens and lowers into a stratus, forming a heavy bank
in the southwest, which gradually extends over and into the northeast,
the whole mass deepening and lowering until nimbus clouds
form and appear moving with the wind. Storms of the greatest
severity and duration are generally with the wind from north-northeast
to east-northeast, and rapidly increase in violence. They
are attended with, or preceded by, a rapid depression of the barometer.
Temperature rises for a veering, and falls for a backing, wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Easterly storms, slowly forming, are attended by moderate winds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Storms from the southeast are often violent, but of short duration,
lasting only from six to twelve hours, and shifting suddenly to the
opposite direction.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Charleston, S. C.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>During the months of April, May, June, July, August, and September,
storms are preceded by slowly diminishing pressure, rising
temperature, increasing humidity, and cumulus clouds, with wind
from the west and northwest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Winter storms come from the northeast and southeast. Those
from the northeast are preceded, for several days, by brisk wind
from that direction, rapidly rising barometer, slowly falling temperature,
increasing humidity, with stratus clouds moving slowly
from the northeast until the whole sky is covered and a dense mist
begins to fall, which soon becomes rain as the clouds approach the
earth. Storms from the southeast are the most dangerous. They
are preceded by light and variable southeast winds, falling barometer,
and rising temperature. The day immediately preceding the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>storm is generally a fine one, with a few cirrus or cirro-stratus
clouds, increasing humidity, wind variable, and rising slowly.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cheyenne, W. T.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rain storms are preceded by a low barometer from twenty-four
to forty-eight hours before their arrival, with wind from southeast,
east, northeast, and north.</p>

<p class='c010'>Snow-storms strike the station from southwest, northwest, or
north, all storms of magnitude coming from the latter direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind-storms are preceded by a low barometer, with much briefer
warning than in the case of rain and snow storms, often occurring
within two or three hours after the first instrumental premonition.
Temperature rises and humidity increases; cirrus clouds move from
west to northwest.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Ordinary rain storms, preceded by falling barometer, increased
temperature, hazy atmosphere, cirrus clouds, and northeast wind.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Corsicana, Tex.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Approach of norther indicated by bank of clouds in north or
northwest when the balance of sky is clear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gentle or brisk east wind precedes rain. Southwest or west
wind indicates the approach of clear, dry weather.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Davenport, Iowa.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rain storms generally preceded by an east, southeast, or south
wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wind storms preceded by steadily falling barometer, with light
wind from southwest.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Denver, Colo.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer, rising temperature, cirro-stratus clouds, with
westerly winds. Most reliable indications of storms are seen to the
north and west on the mountains. A cap of clouds on the high
peaks, or low cumuli below the summits, presage rain or snow.
For wind, a black wall of cloud generally forms between high peaks
and the foot-hills, completely hiding the peaks and extending only
five or ten degrees above the horizon.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Detroit, Mich.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer from twelve to twenty-four hours in advance of
storm, with wind from southeast or northeast.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Dodge City, Kans.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer, with light southeast wind, hazy atmosphere,
cirrus clouds, and low humidity.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Dubuque, Iowa.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Wind storms preceded by rapid fall of barometer, with cirro-stratus
and stratus clouds moving from the west; wind changeable,
backing from southeast to west.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rain storms preceded by slowly falling barometer and large
masses of cirrus and cirro-cumulus moving from southeast. Surface
winds southwest, south, and southeast.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Duluth, Minn.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Northeast storms, preceded by hazy atmosphere and fog over the
lake, the former turning to stratus and the latter to nimbus cloud
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>as storm approaches. Falling barometer, increasing humidity, and
falling temperature.</p>

<p class='c010'>Northwest storms by low and falling barometer, rising temperature,
high and increasing humidity, with cumulus and cumulo-stratus
clouds. This class of storms most frequent in winter and
spring.</p>

<p class='c010'>Northern storms by falling barometer, falling temperature, increasing
humidity, and cumulus clouds; most frequent in winter,
and accompanied by snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southern storms by falling barometer, rising temperature, increasing
humidity, with hazy atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eastern storms by high and rising barometer, rising temperature,
increasing humidity, with stratus clouds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Western storms by falling barometer, high or rising temperature,
and humidity, with heavy banks of stratus clouds in western sky.
Occur at all seasons of year.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fogs are usually followed by rain within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Eastport, Me.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Northeast storms are preceded by slowly falling barometer, falling
temperature, stratus clouds in the east, which spread over the
entire sky.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southeast storms are preceded by heavy fall of barometer, falling
temperature, increasing humidity, stratus clouds, and detached
“scud,” with wind shifting from east to southeast.</p>

<p class='c010'>In summer a continuance of southeast wind is followed by rain.
Sea-gulls gather together in flocks near the shore, uttering a peculiar
cry.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Erie, Pa.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Storms from north, northwest, and west are preceded by falling
barometer, brisk to high southerly winds, rising temperature, and
increasing humidity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Storms from the southwest to southeast are preceded by slowly
falling barometer, rising temperature. With steady south wind at
any season of the year rain is probable within twelve hours.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Fort Gibson, Indian Ter.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer, rising temperature and low humidity, the latter
forming an important element. If wind veers suddenly from
southwest to west, rain follows; if this change occurs slowly, wind
follows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cirro stratus changing to cumulo-stratus twenty-four to forty-eight
hours in advance of storm.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Fort Sully, Dak.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rapidly rising and very high barometer, low temperature, cirrus
or cirro stratus clouds moving from the north or northwest, with
surface wind from southeast, backing to north and northwest.
High summer temperature, usually followed by brisk and high
south and southeast wind.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Galveston, Tex.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“Northers,” preceded by slowly falling barometer, decreasing humidity,
wind south or southeast, veering to north, with cirrus or
cirro-cumulus clouds moving from west or northwest.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><strong>Indianapolis, Ind.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Sudden storms, by sudden fall of barometer, increase of temperature,
high humidity, with haze in lower and cirrus clouds in upper
atmosphere, moving from the west.</p>

<p class='c010'>Winter storms, by high and rising barometer, rising temperature,
low humidity, cirrus and cirro-stratus clouds moving from the west.
These followed by falling barometer, with wind veering to east and
southeast, and stratus clouds.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Indianola, Tex.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“Northers” are preceded by protracted southeast winds, rapid rise
of barometer from four to six hours in advance of storm, high humidity,
with cirrus clouds moving from the west.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Jacksonville, Fla.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer and rising temperature from four to six days
in advance of storm. Hazy atmosphere, wind north to northeast,

east, southeast, and southwest.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Keokuk, Iowa.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer and cirrus clouds, with fresh easterly wind,
precede rain or snow, according to season.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Key West, Fla.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>“Northers,” from October to May, preceded by hazy atmosphere,
easterly winds veering to southerly, cirrus, cirro-stratus, and cirro-cumulus
clouds, moving slowly from the southwest and west, and
finally a bank of stratus clouds in the western horizon, apparently
stationary. Falling barometer, high and rising temperature and
humidity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Cyclones from July to November are preceded by northerly and
easterly fresh and brisk winds, drizzling rains at intervals, for several
days, low and nearly stationary barometer, steady, high temperature,
dark scud flying low, with surface wind, and cirrus, cirro-stratus,
and cirro-cumulus clouds above, moving slowly from the
south and west. The height and action of barometer and state of
weather are the most notable signs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Rain storms prevail from May to November, are preceded by hazy,
close atmosphere, average low barometer, high temperature, rising
of “thunder heads” in the horizon in the direction from which rain
is to be expected, with an almost imperceptible motion and an appreciable
fall of barometer, several hours before storm approaches.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Knoxville, Tenn.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Barometer moves rapidly for a storm of short duration, temperature
rises, wind from east-southeast, south and southwest, from
eight to twenty-four hours previously, with upper clouds moving
from the west, wind stronger and of greater duration, with rising
rather than falling barometer. Rapid movement of cirro-stratus
clouds indicates wind, but is seldom observed.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>La Crosse, Wis.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Barometer falls steadily for twenty-four hours, with rising temperature,
increased humidity, and cirro-stratus clouds before rain.
Wind storms same as above, with addition of cirrus of great elevation
moving in opposite direction to surface wind, and apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>highly electrified. Winter storms are preceded by gentle south or
southwest wind, veering to north or northeast.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Leavenworth, Kans.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Rain storms are preceded from twelve to forty-eight hours by
barometer falling steadily, increasing humidity, high temperature,
with wind east or south, cirro-stratus clouds in southern or western
horizon, and eastern horizon obscured by haze.</p>

<p class='c010'>Red sky at sunrise indicates strong winds; if humidity is much
below the mean, the color is usually a brilliant scarlet; if humidity
is high, the color is more crimson, with a purple tinge and rain follows.
When wind backs from northwest to southwest, clear weather
follows.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Lexington, Ky.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Local storms are preceded by falling barometer, unusually high
temperature, low humidity, and cumulus clouds; northwest storms,
by falling barometer, cirrus clouds and wind veering to east; southwest
storms, by falling barometer, unusually high temperature
with wind backing to east and northeast.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Louisville, Ky.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Barometer falling slowly for forty-eight hours, unusually high
temperature and humidity, cirro-stratus clouds in morning for two
or three days in advance of storm, and light south wind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Winter storms are generally from the northwest, with falling
barometer for twenty-four hours in advance.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Long Branch, N. J.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>For northeast storm, falling barometer, rising temperature, cirro-cumulus
or cirro-stratus clouds, moving from west or southwest
with lower atmosphere hazy. If wind backs to northeast from
southwest, precipitation is greater than when it veers to the same
quarter. For eastern storms same conditions, except, that upper
clouds move from the westward. For northwestern storms the fall
of barometer is most rapid.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Lynchburg, Va.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Long-continued rain storms are preceded from six to twelve hours
by rising barometer, cirrus clouds moving from the southwest, with
surface wind for the northeast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hazy and smoky atmosphere indicates rain. Before rain, especially
when wind is in the south, the leaves of the maple, aspen,
poplar, and willow trees curl up so as to show their under side.
When cumulus clouds drift over low enough to cast perceptible
shadows, rain generally follows within forty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Marquette, Mich.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, rising
temperature, southerly wind, with cirro-stratus clouds moving from
a westerly or southwesterly direction.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Memphis, Tenn.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Northwest storms are preceded by slow fall of barometer at first,
followed by a more rapid fall as storm approaches; fresh southwest
winds, backing to southeast, rising temperature and humidity,
with slow formation of stratus clouds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Greatest rainfall occurs with southeasterly winds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Southwest and west storms are preceded by winds from the northeast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and east, with same instrumental indications as for northwest
storms.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Mobile, Ala.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Barometer falls slowly ten or twelve hours, and more rapidly two
or three hours before storm; stratus clouds with southeast wind.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Morgantown, W. Va.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Falling barometer, rising temperature and humidity, with southwest
or west winds, and cirrus clouds moving from the westward.</p>

<p class='c010'>In winter a storm usually follows a falling barometer, with south
wind. If barometer falls one-tenth of an inch between 7 a. m. and
12 m., bad weather follows within thirty hours. In winter, high
temperatures are generally followed by bad weather, especially if
accompanied by winds varying from northwest to northeast.</p>

<p class='c010'>Increase of humidity between 12 m. and 3 p. m. is usually followed
by rain before night on same day.</p>

<p class='c010'>Backing of wind to southward, with falling barometer, nearly
always followed by bad weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>All wavy forms of cirro-stratus are sure signs of an approaching
storm. In summer, when cirrus moves from northwest or north, a
storm follows within thirty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Mount Washington, N. H.</strong></p>

clouds indicate wind, and when in large quantities rain.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>Nashville, Tenn.</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Barometer falling slowly from twelve to forty-eight hours, increasing
temperature and humidity, cirro-stratus clouds moving
from southwest, with easterly surface wind from one to three days
in advance of storm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crimson sky in morning is generally followed by rain within
twelve hours.</p>

<p class='c017'><strong>New Haven, Conn. (Furnished by Prof. E. Loomis.)</strong></p>

<p class='c010'>Great storms are frequently preceded by an unusually pleasant
day, so that a very transparent atmosphere may, perhaps, be regarded
as an indication that a storm may be looked for within
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the first indications that we are on the edge of a great
storm consists in a slight turbidness of the atmosphere which would
scarcely attract the attention of an ordinary observer, but which is
sufficient to cause solar halos during the day and lunar halos during
the night, if there is a moon. During the colder months of
the year, our great storms are usually preceded by a rise of the
barometer above the mean and a veering of the wind to the northeast.
If the barometer rises considerably above the mean, and is
accompanied by a fresh wind from the northeast, a storm is pretty
sure to follow within twelve hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>A considerable fall of snow is very frequently preceded for several
hours by the same signs (high barometer and northeast wind),
together with a feeling of extreme chilliness, much greater than is
usually experienced with the existing state of the thermometer.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the warmer months a strong breeze from the south, accompanied
by towering cumulus clouds, is pretty sure to be followed
by rain within a few hours, generally a thunder-storm. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>phenomenon which is most decidedly local in New Haven is the
direction of the prevalent wind, together with the diurnal change
in the wind’s direction. During the six colder months of the year
the prevalent wind is from the north-northwest, and the diurnal
change in the wind’s direction is slight. During the six summer
months the wind in the morning usually blows from the north or
northwest, but by noon, and sometimes by 10 a. m., it veers to the
south or southwest, and continues thus for the remainder of the day.
This peculiarity is supposed to be due to the difference of temperature
between the land and the neighboring water, and it modifies,
very sensibly, the direction of the New Haven wind in the neighborhood
of the storm centre. During the passage of a great storm
the wind at New Haven is much more northerly than is experienced
at interior stations similarly situated with reference to a storm
centre.</p>
